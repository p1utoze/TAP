The BAZ Group is a small telecommunication company that provides project management and telephone bill processing. I was hired to help maintain their in-house application that was used to facilitate their telephone bill processing. I helped advise on possible enhancements, design, and future platforms.
Software Developer
I assisted the lead developer in implementing enhancements that would help the processors do their jobs as efficiently as possible.
	Database Query Tuning  this helped the program to run faster making processors time more efficient
	Implemented MVC design pattern  original the pattern was clunky and took longer to implement any changes. By switching to this pattern, we decreased the code base allowing easier maintenance, shorter agile sprints, and overall quicker performance.
	Introduced reflection to program  before this was used there was over 100,000 lines of code, by using this technique we were able to decrease the code by 20% making it easier to look to migrating it to other platforms.
	Added functional programming  one of the many functions of the program was to read and process electronic bill, which resulted in difficult code. By adding functional programming, we created cleaner and more precise code.
	Started a testing lifecycle  before we started testing, the lead developer would write the code, test it himself, and deploy it. By testing the code through a 3rd person we not only have fewer bugs, but we have found 5 previously undiscovered bugs.
	Requirements gathering  for each enhancement, we discuss them with both business stakeholders and as a team to determine value and feasibility. As part of our Software Development Life Cycle we document both the technical requirements and our unit tests.
	Created a 100% open source web platform  if implemented would save business over $5,000 in Microsoft licensing seat cost.
	Created a simple web application based on LDAP security roles  before I created this web application it was a desktop application written in VB6.

Configuration Engineer I (DevOps)
I assisted senior engineers to maintain and gather metric health checks on Unix and Windows servers.
	Create web-based tools to determine server availability  mostly these tools were asp pages but occasionally we would write perl cgi, jsp, and asp.net
	Maintain security passwords  for an in-house application, I did password updates and resets

With Avhan Dial, users get access to state-of-the-art predictive dialing technology combined with the very latest in campaign management tools. Avhan Dial provides real-time statistics regarding current agent performance that allows you to decide where to place new calls.

At Honeywell Hi-Spec Solutions, I led the program management and product development function that grew to a 250+ engineer organization in 11 locations in North America, Europe and Asia. I led the implementation of a PMO and  a stage gate process for portfolio management. Our global team delivered products that increased revenues from $70 million to $300 million in five years. I was fortunate to be recognized with the Lund Award in 1993 - the top corporate award for developing people and delivering business results.
In July 2002, I left Phoenix for a position as Vice President, Automation & Information Systems, reporting to the CEO,  for Union Switch & Signal in Pittsburgh. I had full P&L responsibility for a software focused, 350+ person business unit supplying computer aided dispatching (CAD), scheduling and information management applications to the global rail and transit industry.  We grew both revenues and profits over 2.5 times.  Revenue exceeded $63M.   UK government spending cuts impacted our largest customer, Network Rail, and our contract was terminated. I stayed on through June 2004 to help effect an orderly transition.
For family reasons, I targeted a relocation to Tucson, AZ.  I was Director of Product Development at Misys Healthcare Systems. I led development of our enterprise systems for Hospitals as well as our Connect family that integrates our Misys products from all venues of care with other third party EMR systems through emerging industry standard IHE protocols. My organization had centers in Tucson, San Bernardino, Salt Lake City, Raleigh and Bangalore India.  In addition, I led our configuration management staff and the corporate process improvement program, based on CMMI. My business unit was divested and my organization was split among 3 different companies.
Subsequently, I was with Biovigilant Systems, a startup in Tucson, AZ that was introducing a breakthrough technology, instantaneous microbial detection into the life sciences industries, such as pharma clean rooms. We began shipping product in December in a controlled release as we prepared for FDA DMF filing.  I started as a consultant reporting to the CEO, focusing on software development and then became Vice President, Engineering. I was responsible for all development (software, hardware, mechanical packaging) as well as overall company program management. The Board required severe cost cutting to reduce our burn rate and my position was eliminated.
I just completed an assignment as Director, Product Development, with Invensys Operations Management, a global controls and automation software company. I led a strategic initiative to develop a toolset for our global project delivery organization. It speeds the time and quality of project implementation. It is currently in use globally in our largest projects --exceeding $280M in orders. I also had a special assignment in our offshore strategy. Led the transition of 500+ engineers to an offshore partner in India with minimal impact to deliverable commitments.
I've spent over 2 decades getting the most out of technical professionals. Building environments where commitments are met, innovation can flourish, and continuous process improvement (including Six Sigma, Agile) is a way of life. I've received corporate honors in recognition of my skills as a coach, mentor, and business results leader.
I have spent a career leveraging technology (software and hardware) and people to solve corporate problems -- both internal and external. I believe that my skills and experience are indeed transferable between industries. I have worked in business units from $50M on up to $1B. I have personally led organizations of about 400,  with P&L responsibility, including most functions- e.g. business development, product management,  project management, R&D, engineering,  testing, documentation,  installation and call center product support and corporate IT. I've had to build and maintain strong customer relationships, negotiate contracts, leverage work offshore and perform due diligence on mergers/acquisitions. I've worked in industrial automation (oil/gas,  petrochemical refining, Pharma, Pulp & Paper), transportation and healthcare, and defense market sectors as well as the more traditional IT work.
While other factors such as an exciting job challenge are of primary importance to me, you should know that in recent years, my total compensation has been in the range of $175,000 to $250,000.
Regarding relocation, I am open to moving for the right opportunity.
I look forward to discussing any appropriate opportunities with you.",Available upon request.

Data Scientist
Dr. Anyouzoa is the lead Data Scientist in a company wide effort to use telemetry as tests. The solution relies upon an Analyzers Framework fed by multiple event based systems. Dr. Anyouzoa designed the framework and is actively involved in its implementation. The main requirements were to build a system that will be up 24/7, permit seamless extension and live maintenance (e.g.: the framework should never be brought down for patches). This framework lets individuals across the company add new functionalities to it through the implementation of extensible interfaces (custom analyzers) and dynamic linking. The results of the custom analyzers are routed to the scoring engine mentioned below for advanced statistical analysis. This framework provides engineers with tools to measure the confidence and reliability in data. It is a surface that bridges the gap between the raw data Microsoft collects from billions of machines worldwide and advanced mathematics needed to derive insights from that data. The goal is to enable engineers to leverage advanced and matured mathematics from fields like Information theory, Evolutionary dynamics, etc., without having to deal with the complexity of the required science.
As owner of Windows Telemetry Quality. Dr. Anyouzoa role is to extract wisdom from data. Skills required combine those of an engineer, statistician, artist and scientist to extract the nuggets of gold hidden under mountains of data, ultimately steering innovation through information. Another part of his role is to teach and encourage others to learn new ways to look at data, and push the envelope to help Microsoft get and keep a competitive edge in data science.
Dr. Anyouzoa authored a policy paper for Microsoft executive (VP level) titled: Data Scientists - What does the mold look like? The goal was to provide the executive with guidelines as to where and how to invest in data science related areas to help Microsoft catch up with the competition, and lead the game in this new and promising field.
Dr. Anyouzoa authored a state of the Windows Ecosystem document for Microsoft executive (VP level) titled: Data Driven Engineering at Work Restoring the Windows Eco-Immune System? A 66 pages diagnostic document summarizing the ills of the Windows Ecosystem and a proposing the remedies to fix it.
Dr. Anyouzoa authored a future of quality paper for Microsoft executives (VP level) titled: The Search for Continuous Quality. This two pages document argues that, if quality is a search problem, then quality is a process and should therefore be treated as a continuous process. This paper outlines the mindset and examples of workflows that are more likely to sustain continuous quality at Microsoft.
Dr. Anyouzoa is currently working on an automatic patterns discovery tool that extends the scoring engine technology he created, to analyze large-scale temporal data matrices with billions of entries, using techniques from hyper-spectral imaging. The goal here is to detect pre-symptomatic stress in customers' behaviors.
Sept-2012  April-2013: Microsoft Corp. Redmond, WA
Performance Analyst  Performance Program Manager for Windows Sustained Engineering
This role is to prevent the Windows Operating System from regressing through Windows updates. In this position, Dr. Anyouzoa analyzes Windows Scorecards and makes recommendations on to be released monthly windows updates based on the problems found during the performance Monthly Test Pass (MTP). Dr. Anyouzoa sits in the War Room to make sure that recommendations made from the scorecards analysis are strictly followed.
May-2008  April-2013: Microsoft Corp. Redmond, WA
Performance Analyst
Dr. Anyouzoa is a Performance Analyst and Engineer working on researching means to enhance the overall responsiveness of the Windows operating systems through structured experimental design and analysis using mathematical methods. His responsibilities go as far as to diagnose performance issues in components brought to his attention, and propose fixes that can involve redesigning components to meet specific performance requirements.
Dr. Anyouzoa has designed and implemented a scoring engine to guard the Windows OS against regressions, using Tensors Physics and techniques from Neuroscience. The scoring engine is at the heart of monitoring code flow to prevent code churn from regressing the Windows OS, ultimately preventing such regressions to land into a customers computers. A key pillar for shipping a cleaner, leaner and faster Windows.
Dr. Anyouzoa is in charge of all the mathematics used in the Scoring Engine. This role involves validating all mathematics underlying the design of components used in the scoring engine and other analysis tools used by performance analysts; proposes innovative solutions to protect an ever-evolving OS.
Dr. Anyouzoa has designed and implemented an entropy-based variability allocation system that, in face of variability in systems (machines, code-flows) response, would detect the source of variability in the data stream (machines, code-flow, combination machine\code-flow or other factors).
Dr. Anyouzoa has designed and implemented a C++ based test framework that replaced a Jscript based test framework used to test Windows servers.
Dr. Anyouzoa has designed and implemented a Memory Analysis Tool based on Xperf, SQL Server, and SQL Analysis Services to correlate the frequency of appearance of COW (Copy On Write) pages and different kind of page faults.

Dr. Anyouzoa prepared and co-designs defense-related SBIR and BAA proposals, including the Deep Green BAA; Dr. Anyouzoa was member of the GITIs Deep Green Team, a program sponsored by DARPA. Deep Green consisted of a variety of software that battlefield commanders can feed information into and get feedback forecasts of how a mission might turn out in return. At the center of the system were two pieces of software: ""Blitzkrieg,"" which produces combat models for commanders to consider, and ""Crystal Ball,"" which pools a variety of information and offers up the most likely scenarios and the best course of action.
Dr. Anyouzoa was also the Chief Architect on a CERDEC-C2D sponsored Agent Development Toolkit, a phase II SBIR and Eclipses inspired system where developers will be able to put together societies of intelligent agents, test them and deliver them remotely to warfighters on the battlefield.

Career Highlights
Entrepreneurial Sales Professional
Chuck Wolf began his sales career in high school in the mid Eighties, setting appointments for encyclopedia sales reps, until he was old enough to enter the field sales force. Once he did, he was the youngest rep in the country, setting records as a Newly Wed closer- closing $1500 childrens book sales to couples with no children. He has since been a life long student of sales, and motivational psychology.
He earned his degree in Psychology from Indiana University, Bloomington, and worked nearly full time throughout college mainly telemarketing for the nations largest telemarketing firm representing Fortune 500 companies, as well as a number of non-profits. He regularly doubled and tripled quotas, and set long-standing national sales records. He later became a supervisor, managing call centers of forty reps with hiring, training and firing responsibilities. He attributes some of his success to studying NLP techniques by Bandler and Richards and studying Roger Ailes.  By the age of twenty-one, he was a top performer gaining over five years of aggressive phone experience with organizations including: Universal Distributors-books, Dial America (3 yrs), Special Olympics, Time Life, New York Tel, Chase Manhattan, Fire Fighters, FOP, Kidney Foundation, and The American Heart Association. In college he also sold for an Advertising Agency, and the Award winning student newspaper, The Indiana Daily Voice, handling their largest accounts.
Upon graduation he sold large scale graphics and tradeshow displays, earning a living on straight commission in territory sales for a year before becoming involved in software sales for Computer Business Services where he nearly doubled quotas as a top five percent performer- another 3 years of phone sales (closing over $1mm/yr in $15,000.00 over-the-phone sales).
In the mid nineties Chuck joined the Sr. sales force for the worlds largest software firm  Computer Associates (CA) where he received additional Solutions Selling training in the Enterprise Software arena and sold to named national Fortune level clients (ERP, Y2K, and LCM). In between CBSI and CA, he started two small home based-businesses (computer telephony based) and bought, operated, and sold a million dollar per year Manufacturers Rep firm involving computer clean room technology  (A/C, UPS, Power Conditioning, Surge suppression) with major lines including Excide Electronics, and Tycor Power, selling to airports, hospitals, and large institutions.
He went on to do New Business and Partner development with Internet Start-Ups, developing sales programs and products, heading a national product roll-out to a Fortune 500 VAR,  and selling complex technical projects on an international basis from the US, to Canada and China. He headed the acquisitions efforts of the company, and closed several stock-based, seven-figure transactions.
Beginning in 2001, after the dot-com crash, Chuck bought an (1) established Art Gallery in Charleston, SC, then started three (3) other retail Fine Art Galleries, one (1) outside consulting (business-selling to hospitals, hotels, banks, and corporate clients) and two(2) wholesale print distribution businessesall within a thirty-six month period. At the same time he became President of one of the largest gallery association in the Southeast, where he served two terms, after having served two terms as Vice President. He also served five years as PR Chair, responsible for marketing and advertising for the Association. He created and served on the Membership Committee as well.
From 2004 through late 2009, he ran two high end fine art galleries in tandem, with all of the general business administration, and staff management of any small business, and he was a daily selling sales manager.
Chuck Wolf will describe his strengths as a hard working creative entrepreneurial sales executive with polished client-facing skills, attributing his successes to extensive formal sales training, and sales instincts, combined with ethics, empathy, and a proper attitude.
He has unique sales and marketing experience combination including:
Display and print advertising, graphic design, marketing, trade show marketing, telemarketing, outside sales, inside sales, sales management, sales training, territory management, business writing, contract writing and negotiations. Software skills include CRM, MS office suite, graphics and Web 2.0.

Achievements
(1)	As a result of a study done for a life insurance company, we were awarded the follow-on development work recommended in the study. I was selected to head up the development project. The objective of this development project was to provide on-line access and update capability of the policyholder master file from within the home office as well as from the various agencies around the country.
	I organized and recruited three people needed to work on a project plan,
	I, along with the planning team created the project plan and identified the additional staffing and skills needed to complete the project,
	I, along with the planning team presented the project plan to our management and to the client senior management,
	We obtained the approval of senior management, staffed the project with eight more technical people from our company and four people from the clients shop, bringing the total to sixteen people, including myself,
	Detail design specifications were written and reviewed by the appropriate management and the using department people,
	Computer programs were written and unit tested,
	Client user procedures and documentation was written and approved,
	Status was reported on a monthly basis, to management,
	We performed the system testing,
	We performed user training,
	The computer system was installed into the operational production environment,
	We turned the completed system, along with the documentation over to the client,
	A victory party was held and accolades were passed out to all who contributed to the success of the project,
	I wrote a post mortem report on the project for the project files, identifying improvements that might be considered in future projects,
	I wrote performance reviews for all who worked on the project, for their personnel files,
	I worked with our personnel department in reassigning the people who worked on the project.
Results:	The system provided a significant improvement in turn around time from application to issuance of policy. It reduced clerical errors and improved service and saved the company several clerical positions. The project took sixteen months from inception to completion, with an overrun of 12 %, but with a payback period of two and one half years, a six-month improvement from the original estimate.
Achievements
(2)  Due to waste, inefficient replenishment of materials and supplies and lack of control,
a computer based inventory control system was proposed to the United States 7th Army. I had the opportunity to work on that system while serving in the US Army.
I was assigned to the Plans, Policies and Procedures Department at the 7th Army Stock Control Center. This departments responsibilities included interpreting the Department of Defenses policies, rules and regulations for logistics and supply and for computer programming specifications.
	I worked with computer programmers to generate program specifications,
	I was involved with unit and system testing in validating computer output results,
	I met with logistics experts in documenting suggested improvements to existing
inventory and supply processes,
	I worked with system developers in designing and testing automated processes,
	I took computer programming classes, and wrote some of the computer programs
for the system,
	I was involved in designing the requisitioning objectives and re-order points
logic,
	I worked with inventory control teams in providing lists of inventory, suppose to
be at each of the depots, for their inventory validation and checking,
	I was promoted and received a citation for my hard work and expertise.
Results:	The system made it possible to realize a considerable cost savings to the US 7th Army by ordering in cost effective volumes, helping to control black market selling of popular inventory items and maintaining control and timely replenishment of critical supplies.
Achievements
(3)	While working for a major military contractor, engaged in developing various
weapon systems, we received a directive from the Department of Defense, to use
tighter controls on our development projects. This directive resulted in a software project to develop a project management control tool.
	I contributed to the study and analysis of the tool requirements,
	I wrote some of the system interface requirements documents,
	I assisted with the detail design,
	I wrote and tested some of the computer software,
	I was later assigned to a software development project that utilized the project management tool and was able to provide feedback for improvements to the tool.
Results:	The project management tool was used on several subsequent projects. The tool captured actual effort, costs and elapsed time and compared them to previously entered estimated costs and schedules as well as updating and computing current critical paths with new projected costs to complete estimates and schedules. The tool was designed in such a way as to allow enhancements as project management concepts became more sophisticated and advanced. This tool contributed greatly to tighter controls and provided management with current and accurate actuals compared to estimates and provided updates and projections. Use of this tool allowed the project manager to better control projects and reduced overruns and led to more military contracts being awarded to the company.
Achievements
(4)	A newly formed consulting company, started and incorporated by two principle owners who had connections with a family owned brokerage firm, was awarded the companys first contract. The companys first contract involved a study resulting in a software development project. The purpose of the software system was to automate three major parts of the brokerage business: Order/Trade processing, Security accounting and Customer accounting.
	I was part of a four man team that did the analysis and design of the Order/Trade processing subsystem,
	I wrote the detail specifications on the principle part of the subsystem,
	I was the lead programmer on the subsystem,
	My team created and executed the test plan,
	We trained the client on the use and operation of the system,
	The Order/Trade subsystem was successfully installed.
Results:	The control and accounting of orders and matching trades was achieved. This timely control and accounting resulted in better service and contributed to more timely payment for services rendered. The timely control also reduced the amount of cash being tied up to cover the cost of margin trades for the customers of the client firm, by providing accurate follow up on outstanding orders.",Available upon request.

Siemens Medical Solutions, Software Support Engineer(Dec 2003 - Apr 2005)
Software support engineer troubleshooting customer issues and making minor changes to existing software.
Fixed random scanner connection problems in EDM (Enterprise Document Management)
*	This problem occurred randomly, but I was able to reproduce the problem on my machine
and realized that two TWAIN connections were opened to the scanner, which resulted in conflicts while scanning.
*	One of the TWAIN connections was removed from ASP code to resolve the conflict
Made EDM scanner controls more user friendly
*	Observed users scanning documents without choosing a destination folder
*	Made a fix in C++ code to close scan dialog after a scan was complete, so user would have to select a destination folder before doing another scan
Added TWAIN logging to ActiveX viewer controls in order to troubleshoot scanning issues
*	Logging was needed to troubleshoot problems that could not be recreated in our lab
*	Used C++ to add logging to ActiveX controls to show status of all major TWAIN functions
*	Added a method to turn on and off logging using environment variables
Resolved lockout problem for EDM security module
*	Added security logging in C++ and C# code in order to find the cause of the random lockout
*	Using logs the customer lockout problem was isolated.  One of the clients did not have proper network access permissions and he would receive an 	empty XML problem.  Then the caching mechanism would corrupt other users configuration files causing lockout for everyone
*	Set the proper network access permissions for customer causing the lockout problem in order to solve the issue
Extended the functionality of the upload service that was used to transfer client files to the data center
*	Added an XML key that allows users to add a timestamp to the end of the file name.  This ensured that every file name is unique and files would not 	overwrite each other
*	Added ignore mask xml key to the upload service.  This key allowed users to ignore files that were not needed in the data center
*	All upload service changes were done in C++ using Visual Studio 7.0
Fixed activeX print control
*	ActiveX controls wouldnt print documents in high resolution
*	Changes were made in C++ code to recalculate the scale of a document correctly in order to print documents in high resolution
Added an option to set the default zoom level in EDM software
*	Added a menu item that allowed user to set the default zoom level
*	Added a JavaScript function to set the zoom to the level specified by the user
Fixed large reports processing error
*	A windows service failed to process large reports over 50 Mb in size
*	Made a change in window services C++ code to read reports in 1 Mb chunks to fix the problem
*	This was a critical fix needed for one of Siemens customers to go live on EDM
Xetex Business Systems, Software Developer (July  Oct 2003)
Worked as an entry level programmer.  Extended functionality of existing accounting software and fixed various errors in the software.
Extended the functionality of the Order Entry module

EXPERIENCE
July 01 -  Present RPG/ILE Contract Programming
Programmer Analyst IBM AS/400 I-Series
As a contract programmer I recently completed an assignment with Turning Point Systems, a nationally recognized software development company in Massachusetts with pharmaceutical order entry, inventory, warehouse and similar candy/tobacco applications.  I had a primary significant role involved with programming new modern rewritten RPG GUI portal applications.
The new application consisted of removal of outdated RPG source code indicators replacing them with BIF (Built In Functions).  The newly written programs were compiled with PDM option-15 which actually creates two separate objects with binding directory capabilities.  Additional improvements to the original application were the introduction of numerous user friendly pop up selection subfile windows.
My other recent experience includes working at Resolutions in Vermont successfully updating their system to a current software release that required increasing various field lengths in multiple files, screens and reports.
In a assignment at Granite State Telephone in New Hampshire, I programmed a RPG/ILE split date billing application designed primarily and specifically for telephone carriers like AT&T, Sprint, Verizon etc. when Government regulations mandates billing rates to change in the middle of a monthly billing cycle.

Streamlined and significantly enhanced the business process for performing audits, including:
	enhancing a legacy SQL query to a DB2 database, to select which objects to audit,
	developing Excel and Access macros, to automatically format/transfer the results of the DB2 database query into the Access database,
	creating SQL and Visual Basic code in Access, to auto-fill the audit forms, including automatic assignment of audit objects according to the auditor's areas of expertise,

Subject: Cover Letter
Dear Sirs;
At the beginning of year 2000, I took an early retirement and pursued several hobbies and interests. Including: reading, travel, wood working and various charitable and civic activities.
I served on my towns Economic Development Committee in 2002 through 2003.
I have been doing pro bono work for a fraternal and a charitable organization, performing the following:
-	Designed, developed and maintained a data base using Microsoft Access, for the repository of membership records, reports, labels, etc.,
-	Designed, developed and maintained a spread sheet using Microsoft Excel, to capture and report financial collections and deposits information,
-	Designed and produced reports showing pertinent information from both Microsoft Access and Microsoft Excel.
As my resume would indicate, I have considerable experience and expertise in business analysis,  systems development, project coordination and leadership across a broad range of applications. I am a proponent of team work and have several years experience working on projects that subscribe to this concept. Although it has been a few years since I have worked in a business analyst or team leader capacity, I bring much experience and have much to offer a prospective employer. I have a list of personal and professional references available, upon request.
I am in good health and am anxious to return to work and become productive in the work force once again.
Regards,
.                                                                       .

experience).
I wrote much of the original API documentation for
Apple and SUN.
I am a FrameMaker Guru, an HTML and XML user,
and am one of the top Technical Writers in the
Silicon Valley, with 15+ years experience writing
and managing at companies like Apple, SUN,
Netscape, and Oracle. I've written API for Java and C
++ (13 years experience). CONTACT ME AT 785
856-5929 or eurydice@cruzio.com
Extensive samples in PDF format are available upon
request.
I am currently writing API documentation for Digital
Fountain, whose patented DF Raptor advanced
forward error correction (FEC) technology supports
the efficient delivery of multimedia streams or data
files in the presence of network impairments such
as packet loss and delay.
Before this, I was working as a Senior Technical
Writer with ARC International, a leading developer
of user-customizable, high-performance 32-bit
processor cores, development tools, synthesizable
peripherals, and other cutting edge intellectual
property (IP). I wrote and formatted their most
high-level material (samples upon request).
Before that, I worked for two years with Kana
Communications, as their API Documentation Team
Leader, remaining responsible for all API and
programming documentation. I supervised a team
of writers, in producing documentation that
supported an e-mail management program, and a
number of correlative B2B software products. I was
involved with Kana from their pre-IPO days, and
continued through their period of boom and
growth, managing a team of API writers in
producing both online (XML and HTML) and printed
documentation (FrameMaker).
Just prior to Kana, I had worked two contracts: one
with Netscape, writing the Reviewer's Guide for
Netscape's new Directory Server 4.0; the other
contract with Oracle, writing a series of Marketing
White Papers, on the implementation of Enterprise
JavaBeans, in a CORBA environment.
I was the Senior Technical Writer and Principal
Author, in charge of documenting both Netscape's
Merchant System (the original online shopping mall
system), and writing the correlative Marketing White
Paper. Prior to that, I wrote the API Reference and
original marketing materials for Apples OpenDoc,
in 1993.  I was the lead writer on a project with
JavaSoft at SUN Microsystems, writing API
(Application Programmers Interface) Reference and
User manuals for SUNs new JAVA Foundation
Classes. I also wrapped up a contract with Tibco,
writing API documentation for a Net-resident,
JAVA-based, Internet Market-tracking software.
Prior to that I had a contract with Taligent, where I
wrote C and C++ language API (Application
Programmers Interface) Reference manuals for
Taligents Messaging Interface ERS, which was used
by the messaging framework of Taligents
CommonPoint system.
I have been deeply involved for a number of years
as a Technical Writer and Editor. I presently work as
a Consultant for a number of public and private
agencies. I have extensive experience in the
production of technical manuals and related
documentation for system developers and end
users, corporate communications materials and
brochures, and a wide variety of other printed
promotional materials. I am a start-to-finish man,
and am expert in all phases of the production and
publication process, including over fifteen years of
extensive hands-on experience in the use of
Macintosh, UNIX, and IBM PC desktop publishing
systems and software, and a thorough background
in manual layout, paste-up, and graphics.
I am thoroughly familiar with the UNIX, Macintosh
and PC (DOS) environments, and have worked with
minicomputers and mainframes extensively,
documenting online terminals and LANs (much of
my work has been in the documentation of
networks and of database environments). I am
expert in the use of FrameMaker, Interleaf,
Microsoft Word (all versions), Pagemaker, Ventura
Publisher, and familiar with such systems as Lyrix
and QuarkXPress. Computer systems and languages
that I am most familiar with include JAVA, UNIX, C,
C++, BASIC, LISP, AutoLSP, dBASE, db2, and SQL. In
addition, I have an extensive working knowledge of
DOS and DOS shells, UNIX, Sunview, and X
Windows.
I also worked on the groundbreaking study, by the
Scripps Institute of Oceanography, on the
breakdown of the Ozone layer as a result of the use
of Freon gas in aerosol cans. On this project I was
personally in charge of all documentation and
development of all written materials.
My experience also includes ten years of hard
editorial and writing experience, in both technical
and non-technical fields. I am intimately acquainted
with all aspects of the production process; from
initial documentation and determination of layout
and design, through the subsequent phases of
galley proofs and further layout, to the final
supervision of the printing process itself.
In addition to my specific qualifications, you would
also find me to be a highly focused, committed, and
tireless individual, who brings innovation and
enthusiasm to all projects. I believe in quality,
clarity of expression, and attention to detail.","TELEMARKETER	JANUARY 2005  MARCH 2005
