an assistant public relations director
for the American College of

focused on community outreach
initiatives to educate the public on
digestive health.  Our huge PR push was
during March Colorectal Cancer Awareness
Month, where I collaborated with
physicians to promote the lifesaving
message of colon cancer screening
through the Hometown Papers Initiative
and the National Radio Media Tour.
These efforts resulted in national media
exposure for the ACG in the form of
newspaper clippings and national radio
spots.  Other community outreach efforts
included promoting ""news you can use""
health tips to the general public
through community health events, press
releases and consistent story pitches to
health reporters, both locally and
nationally.
After leaving ACG in 2008, I served as a
producer/writer and publications
coordinator for nearly four years at the
City of Sugar Land.  My communications
work involved producing award-winning

I was given the opportunity to work with and build relationships amongst high profiled clients for the success of the premiere. I maintained a well kept organized schedule of the whole team of the film. The main responsibility was to keep organized schedules and maintain communication with speakers, vendors, and participants. We worked together to coordinate and monitor the event timelines. In working as the assistant, I was able to integrated skills and formatting of the movie and global edition that was sent out. On a daily basis I met with local businesses to build a relation between the director and the firm. I had to maintain a professionalism and light hearted relationship with the businesses that anyone on the team might be able to communicate and receive answers. I supervised the formats of emails and responses to the public and media giving advice and a creative edge to the format being sent out. I was responsible to finding the reviews and analyze evaluations on the improvement needed. Part of my responsibility was to create and proof press packs, press releases, interviews, and consumer publications that were distributed on the green carpet and tent. I arranged the green carpet event, while maintaining and overseeing the production within the tent that held high profiled clients, including presidential level political leaders. Leading up to the event, I had much experience in the administrative skills, outreach, and personal assistant positions. I had to plan, organize, coordinate, promote, and facilitate events that lead up to the premiere. The week before I had to coordinate participation in charitable contribution with sponsors, act as a prime knowledge of the promotion of activities and special events that were scheduled, and took the initiative to coordinate and participate in all efforts to publicize the premiere.
Within the event, I managed the tent organization/script, a team of individuals with direct orders, and became a personal assistant to an A list celebrity that needed extra security. It became a seamlessly orchestrated event that used all aspects of event management, including site selection, negotiation, proposal planning, transportation arrangements, on-site management, and scripted elements of the evening. I was able to demonstrated leadership in prior meetings, maintaining the agendas, organizing within the main event, and the publications of the press for our profiled celebrities. It was a challenging task but with dedication and a team of individuals we were able to pull off the event. I had to work with and built relationships amongst the high profiled clients for the success and trust that my team would be able to give the personal assistance they needed while managing the tent. I was very detail-oriented and able to forecast solutions that were needed for each problem that were experienced in the event. I was essentially a good planner that the guests had a very good time even when some things were not as planned on our side. After the event, I worked with the wranglers and political staff to organize a safe leave of the profiled clients. Once everyone was off the premise, I stayed with my team to clean up. We were able to get to work diligently and effectively in order to get back to the office where we began to edit and transcript the event to be sent to other countries. Once we finished the transcribing and editing, we sent 7 minute segments to the other 63 countries that were showing the event. We had a debriefing session and have finished up the last little bits before the end of this week."

re: Mr. Nabil Georges
To Whom It May Concern:
It is my pleasure to recommend to you Mr. Nabil Georges as an Arabic-English interpreter and translator. I have found him to be a skilled, hard-working and reliable professional.
I met Mr. Georges while preparing for trial in united states v. Harb, a criminal case tried in U.S. ""District Court in Richmond, Va. in September 1994. The Harb case involved exports
in violation of the embargo imposed against Iraq in 1990. Before trial, Mr. Georges was retained by the us. Customs Service to translate a large volume of documents from Arabic to English. He was quick with his responses to our requests, despite the length
and complexity of the documents.
I was especially impressed with his ability to translate scientific and technical documents. Most of them dealt with industrial applications of scientific instruments and high-tech electronic components. Many of the documents were hand-written, and some were only partial scraps of paper. Nevertheless, Mr. Georges produced accurate and useful translations which were
never challenged by the defendants, who were themselves
Jordanian born college-educated and fluent in both Arabic and English. several days of testimony by Arabic-speaking witnesses at trial. His English was excellent and his voice was clear and easy for the jury to comprehend. He maintained a professional demeanor
throughout the proceedings.
I am happy to recommend Mr. Georges to you. If you have any further questions, feel free to call at 804-111-2186.
Very truly yours,

-------------------------
CEO/OWNER/BROKER - Three years ago I took my business knowledge and launched my owned business, New Construction Source, Inc., a Real Estate brokerage firm specializing in new homes sales. Utilizing my many industry contacts I was able to become an independent Outside Consultant selling new homes for every national builder in Southern Riverside County. I personally handled the sales, marketing, data research, promotions, and advertising as well as account payables/receivables and all escrows and mortgage loans.
NEW HOME REAL ESTATE AGENT/BROKER  I managed large new construction communities for four national builders; Ivory Homes, KB Homes, KHovnanian Homes and Richmond American Homes for more than 13 years. I consistently managed a backlog of up to 100 escrows simultaneously that is 100 families, all with special needs.  This is a fast-paced, high stress type of industry requiring daily hands-on supervision of up to 100 open escrows simultaneously. Each home at different phases of construction and with different customizations, client needs, challenges and deadlines.  No two homes are ever the same and no two families are ever the same. Meticulous record keeping and paperwork was required for all internal files, as well as coordinating innumerable schedules, management meetings, reporting, coordinating construction and customer service staff.
MORTGAGE BANKING - I spent approximately five years with Imperial Savings and Loan. I carried several positions though promotions.  I started as an Assistant Trader at the corporate level in the Secondary Marketing Department, to File Auditor for the closing department and finally a Closing Manager for a local Mortgage Loan Office. I have a complete and thorough understanding of the lending industry, loan packaging, credit review and underwriting guidelines.
PROPERTY MANAGEMENT - For two years I single-handedly started up and managed the Property Management division for a busy Century 21 office. I handled more than 250 rental units by myself. All low-income government assisted housing projects involving a high degree of rules and regulations. I handled every aspect from new client sales, advertising, maintenance and repairs, application screening, inspections, accounts payable and receivable and legal evections process when necessary.
INTERIOR DESIGNER - Utilizing my degree in Interior Design, I spent approximately five years as an Interior Designer. I have successfully designed and executed 100 beautiful homes, rooms, remodels, kitchens, offices, vinyets and store displays with such companies as Ethan Allen, La Jolla Baywood Kitchens, LA Pacific Design Center, and RCWilley Home Furnishings. I have extensive expertise and natural talent in the areas of lighting, color, space planning, drafting and blue prints, and working with contractors.
