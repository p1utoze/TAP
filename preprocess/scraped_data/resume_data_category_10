Responsibilities included the origination of applications, the pre-qualification of clients, the ability to uncover needs and the know-how to find the best loan program to meet those needs and  the ability to build a strong rapport in order to earn their business.
I read something recently at https://www.thriveglobal.com/stories/13566-if-you-re-too-busy-for-these-5-things-your-life-is-more-off-course-than-you-think that resonated with me: No one cares about your success more than you do.  When I stopped to really let those words percolate, I had to admit to myself that I definitely hadnt been caring enough.
Ive spent nearly 2½ years working third shift in a Tier 2 automotive manufacturing facility.  During that time, I averaged a 65-hour work week (peaking at 84 hours).  I almost always worked at least six days a week, oftentimes seven.  The environment was hot, dirty, and oftentimes fraught with danger.  Case in point: less than a month into my tenure there, I was hit by a reckless forklift driver resulting in an excruciating crush injury to my right foot.  The recovery took months and obliterated the entire summer of 2015.  Throughout my time there, I kept hoping and praying that something better would come along.
With over 20 years of experience in consultative sales, including several years in the mortgage industry as a Senior Account Executive, you can be confident that partnering with me is a no-brainer.  I look forward to speaking with you in the near future.","Bachelor of Science in Accounting - Fordham University, Bronx, NY

- Showed each Loan Officer how to identify sources of business, make initial contact with said sources, ask for the business from those sources and set up mutually agreed upon terms for monthly administration and follow up on each source.
- Many sources of business were unique to GMAC Mortgage and I managed and supported each Loan Officer through the detailed process. These unique sources included: GM and Delphi Plants, GM Dealerships, Supplier Companies to General Motors, GMAC Real Estate Offices, GMAC Insurance Agencies. Because of the unique relationship between GM and each of these sources, each Loan Officer had to complete a training course to become certified to call on these opportunities. Each certification required annual continuing education requirements to retain the certification.
- Marked, originated, negotiated and managed my own pipeline of loans. This included interviewing the customer, taking the initial application and identifying the best type of loan to meet the customers needs.

Dear Recruiter:
My name is Duane Buziak. My passion and greatest experience is indeed in sales, management, growing business, and building successful teams that produce consistent, outstanding results, including multi-unit sales management. Previous to my years in banking I had a terrific management record in restaurant, grocery, hospitality and retail. I worked for solid Fortune 100 companies such as Wegmans and category killers such as Dicks Sporting Goods. My last Store Manager role (Multi-Unit Store Management) also led to Sales Manager of the Year Honors in 2004.
Even with this unexpected time off I do not rest on my laurels. It is very indicative of who I am and the passion that drives me. In that respect I have just completed courses and examinations to become officially licensed for Property & Casualty in the State of Ohio. Relocation is fully anticipated and will not be an issue.
I possess a very strong, extremely positive work ethic. Many describe me as a rock-solid team leader who builds business and has surpassed the highest expectations of those for whom I have ever worked.
Throughout the years, I have always been an overachiever. The combination of my education, experience, and enthusiastic attitude makes me the ideal candidate for this position. I have a proven track record as a definitive leader with strong sales savvy, along with operational excellence, and I am excited about the prospect of bringing to your team my determination and expertise.
I graduated top five in Business from SUNY, all the while working Full-Time Supervisory and Management positions. My resume includes being an Officer for two of the top 10 largest commercial banks in the United States, having almost 20 combined years of Supervisory and Management experience. I would greatly appreciate being considered for any management openings, as my results are unparalleled.
I have many references, including 35 recommendations on LinkedIn page. Should additional references be required, they can be produced upon request.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Respectfully,
Duane M Buziak",Available upon request.

Perhaps my timing is opportune and you are currently seeking a Financial Business Analyst with these attributes.
Through the use of internal and external data, I developed databases, scoring models, and tracking systems that automated and upgraded customer information.  This enabled faster and more accurate data analysis.
I am a well respected problem solver, who remains calm under pressure, and wins cooperation at all levels.  I am always willing to try new approaches and equally comfortable working alone or as part of a team.
When a consumer loan company did not have a credit risk tracking system, I created a database and implemented a tracking system, saving millions in vendor fees.  In another situation, I developed a fraud tracking model that eliminated false positives and saved $50M in annual losses.
My BS in Business Administration is from Elmhurst College, and I have supplemented my education with industry courses such as Credit Risk Management and Project Leadership.

My name is Wesley Glines Jr and I am desperately looking to relocate to the area and seeking employment someplace close.  My fiancé resides locally and was just diagnosed with MS.  We are trying to move things forward so I can get to the area and help her and her daughter.  I hope you will take a few minutes and review my resume and see if there is any possible way I can assist you.
You will see that I started as a teller in banking and my last position I was VP/Director of Audit and Security.  I only spent 6 months as a teller before I was promoted to the banks sole audit in my first banking position.  I started as sole auditor and went to audit manager, director of audit, and VP/Director of Audit and Security.  Internal audit has given me extensive knowledge of all parts of financial institutions so I am very confident I would hit the ground running in almost any position.  Please do not let my resume give you the impression that I expect to stay at the executive level on my move.  My concern is to relocate to the area and I am very confident I would work my way right back up as I did before.  I would be willing to talk about any position from teller on up.
You will notice that my work history ends in 2007 on my resume.  In my last position I found myself in a family owned bank involved in loan fraud, laundering, and serious BSA violations.  Even tax evasion by the family that owned the bank.  When I find a serious problem in my audits or theft investigations I always try to handle things in house to avoid bad publicity and employee gossip but in CO I was approached by the OCC, IRS, and Federal Marshalls asking for assistance on their 5 year investigation of the bank and the owning family.  I was reluctant until they told me about the violations they were investigating.  The seriousness of the allegations and things I had seen in my short time there forced me to assist.  In nine months I gave them enough info to order the bank be sold and the owners were brought up on various banking charges and federal tax evasion charges.  The bank sold and all officers were released and I lost my job.  Due to the very stressful situation I found myself in there I took some time to decide if I wanted to stay in banking and worked for myself doing contract audit work for previous contacts.  Then I had a serious accident which required a number of surgeries and I was out of commission for around a year.  I am 100% healthy now and ready to pick my career back up.  I hope you will take a careful look at my resume and give me the chance to help you any way I can and keep me in mind for anything in the future also.

	Confronted issue of the websites
responsible for foreign national
economic data not always being to
provide data via their English language
websites (e.g. Brazil and Vietnam), for
which websites such as Google Translate
are of little use, since the terminology
related to economic data is so specific.
To address this, dictionaries were
located that provided translations of
the terms needed to navigate the native
language websites and obtain the needed
data, resulting in the supervisors being
enabled to publish and present numerous
studies related to monetary policy in
the developing world over the next
several years, and resulting in personal
supervisors becoming the most published
authors in the entire department across
both the Gulf Coast and Hattiesburg
campus, producing more research than

As a Senior Account Executive, I strategically identified key business initiatives, analyzed markets, developed sales plans, and drove unprecedented revenue. I grew a dead-end sales program from $10M to $125M. My planning and implementation consistently provided more with less. I believe I can be an asset to your organization.
With a proven record as an individual and a team contributor, I surpassed performance objectives, driving market share growth and increasing operational efficiencies. I effectively built new territories and grew brand awareness, increasing client confidence and ensuring customer satisfaction.
Peers view me as client focused, able to build strong, enduring relationships and meet and exceed customer expectations. I demand excellence of myself and foster it in others.
When Bank of America sought a bigger share in the student loan market, I personally delivered  yearly revenues of $1.75M. Doing more with less, I drove efficiency 28% while helping boost revenue from $300M to $3B. I assisted in the development of a lending consortium that generated over $70M in new sales.
Seizing the opportunity to turn around an underperforming program, I evaluated our market and nurtured key client relationships, boosting consumer confidence. My efforts drove the sales volume from $10.5M to $125M+ in just five years.
I believe my attention to the customer, along with my energy and genuine enthusiasm for my product will significantly contribute to your companys success. I look forward to your call. For more information on my background, please view my resume at michaelfoster.resumeconnect.com.

Financial reporting, secondary market operations. As we grew loan volume, I helped capitalize by negotiating a $5 million warehouse line of credit allowing us to pool loans and make bulk sales in the secondary market. This process brought on more risk, but netted an average of 85 basis points on all dollars lent. I established a risk management program to prevent borrower or internal fraud, and reduce the chance of loan buy backs or borrower default. We operated this line with zero buy backs and very few loans requiring alternate actions. I worked extensively with our accounting firm to understand our financial position with a more complicated balance sheet.

Working with a co-manager, we built a 50 station call center running shifts from 8am to 10pm daily generating 75% of the companys leads for 23 offices across the US.

June 2006 to March 2007
As an independent contractor / consultant I provided my clients with a strategy which allowed them to eliminate market risk while retaining substantial profit potential through a participation in the Standard & Poors 500 Index, having returned 8.5% per year for the past nine years. The pre-eminently important feature of this strategy provides elimination of risk followed by the opportunity to achieve potential profits after a substantial decline in the S&P 500 without having to first retrace the decline in the index.
Consultant
Zedek Corporation in Hingham, MA
December 2005 to June 2006
I researched the potential profitability of the Bald Eagle silver mine in Idaho, located in the Seven Devils mountain range, adjacent to the steepest gorge in North America near the Snake River. This analysis required extensive geological survey analysis, coordination with various officials at the Idaho National Park department and a feasibility study as to the profit potential of the mine. Future silver price extrapolations based on supply-demand analysis, equipment logistical analysis and weather-related factors entered into the overall conclusions.
I also helped coordinate a feasibility study for the building of a facility for the Martha Foundation, a charitable organization dedicated to helping cognitively-challenged adult children. The study analyzed the need for such treatment on an ongoing basis, concentrating on whether the Martha Foundation could be self-sustaining by relying on funds from the private sector or whether it would require government assistance in order to become a going concern.
Additionally, I contacted several builders such as Toll Brothers, Pulte Homes to ascertain their potential interest in purchasing finished lots on luxury home golf course community, Black Rock CC in Hingham, MA. Several discussions and meetings transpired.

Each seminar consisted of four sessions of 2.5 hours per session. I provided a detailed, comprehensive, written financial plan which answered virtually every question pertaining to how to attain a successful retirement.
I also was personally responsible for opening a $300,000,000 account with the IBM retirement plan. I originally contacted the manager at IBM and determined that his parameters required a strategy which is ""outside the box"" which is also ""imaginative and creative"".
By setting up a meeting with a manager who met these criteria I followed up and ultimately implemented the plan with him, having proven to him that I was able to attain substantial incremental return potential for him with no additional incremental risk. (Theoretically, according to Messrs Markowitz and Sharpe who were awarded the Nobel prize in Economics for their ""efficient frontier"" theory, this was impossible for me to attain for him; but I did.)",San Diego State University,"	Sub-prime and conforming lending.
