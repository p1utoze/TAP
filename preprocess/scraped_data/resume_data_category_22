My name is Don Richardson and as you can see by my resume I have extensive experience in working with projects in America and Europe.  I have technical skills, certifications and real life experience on a multitude of projects with many areas of technical issues.
More important is working with the client. Often people in the technical industry forget this. In all honesty this is the most essential issue with the technical field. Dealing with the people that need your help is in many ways is paramount to success in this area. I have the experience in this area along with my technical skills to provide a successful end effect. This in turn leaves the client feeling confident in the service that was provided.
I enjoy working with the client in this industry the best. It does not matter if it is over the phone, in person, or in front of a classroom, a little empathy and respect goes a long way.  To you in the tech field it may be a small easy thing to restore or repair. To the client it is the device they need to do the job and it needs to be functioning so they can continue with that assignment in a timely manner.
I have been working with IT issues and customer service for over ten years and to be honest I enjoy the challenge of resolving difficult issues with positive results.
If you have any questions please contact me

that I had borrowed for starting my own business. I used a quick Google search to
fix the problem but that did not help me.
I then decided to get professional help to solve my problem. After having received
many quotations from various companies, I decided to go ahead with Online Tech
Repair (www.onlinetechrepairs.com).
Reasons I chose them over the others:
1) They were extremely friendly and patient with me during my initial discussions
and responded promptly to my request.
2) Their prices were extremely reasonable.
3) They were ready and willing to walk me through the entire process step by step
and were on call with me till i got it fixed.
How did they do it?
1) They first asked me to state my problem clearly and asked me a few questions.
This was done to detect any physical connectivity issues with the printer.
2) After having answered this, they confirmed that the printer and the laptop were
functioning correctly.
3) They then, asked me if they could access my laptop remotely to troubleshoot the
problem and fix it. I agreed.
4) One of the tech support executives accessed my laptop and started
troubleshooting.
5) I sat back and watched as the tech support executive was navigating my laptop to
spot the issue. The issue was fixed.
6) I was told that it was due to an older version of the driver that had been
installed.
My Experience
I loved the entire friendly conversation that took place with them. They understood
my needs clearly and acted upon the solution immediately. Being a technical noob, I
sometimes find it difficult to communicate with tech support teams. It was a very
different experience with the guys at Online Tech Repairs. You can check out their

The computer consisted of a CPU, a small memory, and some I/O (switches, LEDs, and Seven Segment Displays). The computer designed to compute standard data processing such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, comparison, etc. using VHDL with three teammates.
Vending Machine Design: Designed, simulated, implemented, and tested a special-purpose combinational logic Vending Machine using VHDL design entry on Altera FPGA. The Vending machine accepts nickels, dimes, and quarters and determines the amount of money to be returned to the user after a purchase. The number of nickels, dimes, and quarters to be returned is displayed on a seven-segment display based on the total amount of money entered. The user is also notified by lightning an LED when invalid money is entered for a purchase.
Amplifier Design: Designed, built, and tested an audio amplifier circuit which amplifies a signal from a microphone and drives a   speaker using Operational Amplifiers (op-amps). A soft-spoken voice results in a fairly loud output from the speaker.

The technology sector has played a large part in the role of developing my sales skills.
When I examine my career, I see an ever developing awareness of how to analyze an organizations needs and limitations, and then to function as a change agent by making recommendations of products or services which provide results. My Masters Degree in Business Organizational Management has reinforced and added to my capabilities to deal with all areas of business organizations.
In order to provide effective alternatives that convince clients to make changes in their organization, it is necessary to provide logical, facts providing calls for action via personal and written presentations. These efforts create motivational catalysts for change by requiring a decision to purchase products or services. These activities are governed by Consultative and Spin Selling discovery methods presented in a way to uncover the true departmental needs, budget availability, and value proposition.
What I have learned over the years in technical industries is that these same elements of success and business accomplishments can be transferred to any organization and industry.
During my recent studies and completion of my Masters program in Organizational Management, I focused on management strategies including sales, marketing and other relevant programs to promote growth and retain existing clients.",Available upon request.

July 2008","Professional Experience Statements
Datatel Supply Corporation
Store Manager (Myrtle Beach, SC)
Mar 2008  Oct 2008
Organize, sell, order and stock a store that markets to wholesale customers data, audio, video, network and computer hardware. Assisted some customers with understanding how certain components work best with specific hardware, what hardware to purchase for a particular job, and the best way to configure certain hardware.
Hewlett Packard
Technical Support Engineer III (Fort Collins, CO)
2002  2007
As a support engineer I would access an HP proprietary application that was setup to keep a record of customer phone calls with their computer issues.   These cases would be logged by front line agents for HP business desktop, workstation, and laptop computers and other non-HP equipment needing repair.
I would select a customers case, according to the priority of the customers contract, and review it.  Based on the cases documentation, I would determine if the customers equipment needed further troubleshooting. If I felt that the case documentation was not complete, I would call the customer and perform additional troubleshooting steps with them to try and resolve the issue.  If I was unable to resolve the customers computer issue I would determine what hardware was needed to fix the issue, order it and dispatch a field technician to the customers site.
If the field technician had any logistical issues with the hardware that was shipped or was unable to resolve the customers computer issue, they would call me for my assistance. I also worked with them on business specific non-HP hardware.
Additionally, I would receive calls from some business customers, who did not have IT departments and needed assistance with setting up their new computer(s).
Some of my customers were:
Hess Oil
Friendlys Ice Cream
Brinker Restaurant Corporation  (Chili's Grill & Bar, Romano's Macaroni Grill, On The Boarder and Maggianos)
Federated Stores - Macys
State Farm Insurance
John Deere
Rent-a-Center  (Business computers purchased by home users)
UPS Store
Coordinator / Customer Support
1996  2001
As a front line agent, I was responsible for documenting the customers computer issues in an HP proprietary application.  I would then perform some basic troubleshooting, with the customer, in order to try and determine the issue with the system.  These cases would be sent to backline engineering for review.
While I was working as a front line agent, I realized that there was a need to access specific customer service contract information that was currently not available to my group.  This information would help our group better serve the customer.  Therefore, as an independent project, I created and maintained a knowledge-base (utilizing Microsoft FrontPage software), on an intranet website, which contained the necessary customer contract information for the use of our call center.
Teledyne Water Pik
Network Services Technician I (Fort Collins, CO)

Dear Sir or Madam:
My present responsibilities as a self-employed computer consultant closely mirror the duties you are looking for. I currently support a Novell Netware 5.1 along with some Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Peer to Peer networks.   I diagnose and troubleshoot hardware and software problems daily.  I work with proprietary software vendors, learning their software to support local users. Additionally, I have experience with the Microsoft Office products, and I work with and support DSL, T1 lines, cable modems, and 56K modems.
Having been successfully self-employed for the past fifteen years, I have honed my customer service skills and have often had reason to collaborate with others.  My strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail have greatly assisted me in maintaining my business.  For the reasons I have outlined here, I know I could benefit your firm as a full-time employee or Contractor.
Should you be interested in an independent contractor, rather than a full-time employee, I am well qualified to be your Computer Consultant.  I can offer you a monthly maintenance contract, or a time and material contract.  In addition to the skills I possess, I have high quality back-up in the unlikely event that I might not be able to provide services personally.
I am fluent in Spanish, read, write and speak Spanish.
Salary Requirements: Negotiable
I am presently attending New Horizons Learning Center for certification as an ""Ethical Computer Hacker"". As I finish course segments I take my certification exam.
Present   Certifications: A+ Hardware & Systems and Net plus. I'll be taking more certification until my goal as a Certified Ethical Computer Hacker (Security) is reached.
Respectfully,
