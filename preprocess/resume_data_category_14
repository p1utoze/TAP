-Marilyn Monroe","Small gold wash plant is a kind of mobile gold separation equipment on lland. composed of feed hopper,tommel,water pump,support frame,mobile device,diesel generator,gold chutes, etc. As you continue to grow and experience different growing environments, you will learn to select the right gold wash plant for your needs and environment. The first thing you will want to do is figure out what is the best size gold wash plants for your home. You do not want to end up with a plant that does not live up to your expectations. When growing your small gold wash plant collection in the garden or under the bed, you want to keep in mind that they need to have enough light for photosynthesis. If you leave the plant exposed to too much sunlight then it will not be able to produce enough photosynthesis. You will also want to have the plant watered often. This helps make sure that the plant is able to keep producing nutrients for photosynthesis even during periods of drought. The gold heap leaching is usually used for vulcanized primary ore and the ores with low silt content and high recovery rate are easy to concentrate during flotation. After the flotation and concentration, the gold grade is improved, less material gets into cyanidation procedure. The consumption of cyanide is reduced, and as a result, the environmental pollution is minimized. In this way, construction investment and production cost is reduced and the goal of on-site gold concentration is achieved. Gold shaking table is a gravity separation equipment of separation different weight mineral by asymmetric reciprocating motion. The course ore deck is designed for recovering particles size from 0.5mm to 2m; The fine sand deck is designed for recovering fine particles in the range of 0.074mm to 0.5mm; The slime deck is designed for recovering super extremely fine particles in the range of 0.05 mm to 0.074 mm.
The portable gold wash plant is portable gold wash plant, which belongs to GT series. It is mainly used in mines, coal, electricity, construction, chemicals, etc, which can classify, desliming, and dehydrate to coarse size materials. With the upgrading of GT rotary screen, this rotary screen is widely used in the working of early stage in placer/alluvial gold processing. At the same time, it also can screen and loose the placer/alluvial gold with a high content clay matching rotary scrubber or chute feeder.

It can help you provide all-purpose storage for both long and short materials. Heavy duty cantilever racks also called arm rack, which are a medium to extra heavy-duty storage solution with load-bearing arms anchored to a steel column. These frames leave the front of the racks unimpeded by structural elements for direct pick access to goods. Heavy duty cantilever racks help provide efficient storage and retrieval of long materials like steel bars and tubing. Drive in pallet racking and drive through rack systems decrease storage and retrieval time while increasing efficiency and productivity among workers. Not only do they benefit your operations, they can also decrease your bottom line by giving you more storage room per dollar spent on racking. Because these racks create a more uniform load in a confined storage area, your forklift operators working in the system become more skillful drivers. In addition, it is very energy efficient. Since the product is so densely loaded in this type of system, there is less air to be heated or cooled between your pallets and your forklifts don't need to drive as far to pick or place loads, thereby using less fuel. Teardrop pallet racking will offer direct access to each pallet for simple stock management. It is the most popular and versatile in the material handling industry and is your best answer for warehouse palletized products. Teardrop can be constructed for a variety of uses depending on your storage specifications. Our rack solutions offer a durable powder coating and baked enamel finish to ensure long life under the most challenging conditions.
Radio shuttle racking is one kind of high density storage system. It is a new kind of storage management systems, with high density storage racking and electrically powder pallet runners and working with forklifts. It consists of racking system, trolley & forklift. Such high density storage system can increase warehouse space utilization with less operation time, saving the labor cost.

Performance Improvement","Dear Hiring Manager,
First, let me thank you for taking the time to review
my credentials. On May 2nd, 2015 I graduated with
a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering
and a minor in Physics and Mathematics. In
summary, I am moving to the San Francisco by July
4th and I feel that my mechanical design
understanding, creative troubleshooting abilities,
and diligence can contribute greatly to future
innovation of the Mechanical Design Industry.
I am very passionate about design and have
dedicated myself to pursuing it. For the duration of
my pre-collegiate schooling I was enrolled in
competitive visual art schools where I developed my
spatial reasoning, creativity, and appreciation for
aesthetics. My uncommon background has helped
me to complete my Mechanical Engineering degree
at the FSU College of Engineering and excel in the
design, modeling, and simulation of mechanical
systems. Furthermore, my unique visual abilities
and intuitive understanding of mechanics have
helped me to break down complex problems in
unconventional and innovative ways. During my
junior and senior years I enrolled in design focused
courses, such as Machine Design, Vehicle Design,
and Finite Element Methods, where I excelled at the
use of CAD, FEA, and other programming software.
I have also worked within the R&D department at
the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory where I
developed a full CAD assembly of the 30 Tesla
Hybrid magnet that is currently being used at the
facility. I was later hired on as an employee where I
have helped to develop and implement a bottom-up
process that improves manufacturing logistic
management and reliability.
I have worked since the age of 14 and understand
the value in work ethic, responsibility, and
discipline. Furthermore, having to support myself
through college has taught me crucial time
management skills and how to prioritize effectively.
During my schooling at the FSU College of
Engineering I was one of a handful of students who
founded the FSU Chapter of Theta Tau, a national
professional engineering fraternity. As founding Vice
President I helped to promote student interest,
which resulted in more than doubling the size of the
organization. I was later elected President and not
only ensured that infrastructure of the organization
was sustainable, but that the organization itself was
a prosperous student organization culminating in
our initiation as an official chapter and a student
presence of over 70 members.
I believe that these skills coupled with my technical
degree and passionate determination would make
me an advantageous addition to your team. I would
love for the opportunity to sit down with you in the
future to detail my experiences listed above and
answer any particular questions you may have.
Thank you for your time,
Jonathan W. Jennings",None,Available upon request.

this OVER THE PHONE? That's just
crazy. Buying a new PC, printer, or
monitor? Most major retailers will now
happily offer to take as much as $200
off your hands to come to your house,
pull the machine out of the box, plug
it in, and load the setup disc (if
indeed one exists). One well-known
national chain charges $150 to help
you set up your new printer over the
phone. That's highway robbery. Unless
you're physically unable to lift the
hardware onto your desk, don't even
think about paying good money for 10
minutes of cable connecting and menu
surfing. Most new displays and
printers will simply start working in
Windows just moments after you plug
them in, even without installing their
setup discs. And a new PC will walk
you through the registration and
Internet-connection process with such
careful hand-holding that it's
inconceivable you'd require a pro's
help. When you buy a new PC, many
stores will offer to transfer all your
data from your old machine to the new
one--for as much as $100. But if
you're moving from Windows XP or Vista
to Windows 7, Microsoft's free Windows
Easy Transfer utility can make the job
a no-brainer for any DIYer. If a shop
offers to transfer your data for less
than the cost of a $20 Easy Transfer
cable, go for it. Otherwise, consider
doing it at home. If you do feel like
you need a hand, just about any
neighbor kid over the age of 10 will
be able to do the job, and will
probably accept a 10-spot for the
trouble. Data Recovery: Hard drives
can fail. Houses can burn down. Human
error can result in lost data. When
these things happen, you may find
yourself weeping over the loss of all
your digital photos, your music
collection, essential business
information, and more. Professional
data-recovery companies can typically
get all of your lost data back for you
(even from a fire-damaged hard drive),
but you can expect to pay in the
thousands for the service. It may
sound like a rip-off, but these
companies use advanced computer
forensics systems that are wildly
expensive in their own right and
require deep technical expertise that
you won't find at the tech shop down
the street. The best way to avoid
finding yourself at the mercy of data-
recovery services is to back up your
PC often, using a cloud-based service
such as BackBlaze, Mozy, or Trend
Micro SafeSync. By frequently backing
up to a remote service, you'll always
have a recent copy of all your data in
a secure location. If your hard drive
fails, your computer burns up in a
fire, or someone runs off with your
laptop, you can get every bit of data
back all by yourself. Compared with
the cost of professional data
recovery, $60 a year for online backup
is a bargain. Let us help you in

Summary
My name is Cooper Shattuck, and I am 21 years old. I have been doing CAD since high school. From October of 2010 to October 4, 2012 I worked at Brazeway, in Adrian, Michigan.
Brazeway is a leader in their field of refrigeration and HVAC components. They design and manufacture aluminum evaporators, steel wire on tube condensers, and copper heat exchangers for refrigeration. For the HVAC side, they design and manufacture aluminum Micro Multi Port tubing; aluminum enhanced round tube, aluminum smooth round tube, and aluminum hairpins. To view in more detail of what Brazeway does, please click the provided link.

With my CAD career I have worked with several different CAD programs. At the LISD Tech Center I used AutoCAD 2008, AutoCAD 2010, Inventor, Revit Architecture, and I-deas. At Brazeway, I work with Solidworks 2008, Solidworks 2010, and Draftsight. Although I do not have my degree yet, I have learned a lot at Brazeway and I am excited to have the chance to learn new things.
In my life outside of work and school I am a husband and a father. I have a little girl that was born January 4th, 2012. I enjoy deer hunting in the fall with my wife, as well as the occasional rabbit hunting. I also enjoy rodeo, as I have been team roping from the time I was seven.

Drafting Consultant, February 2004  November 2004, July 2007  September 2007
Consulting  Self Employed ~ Throughout, MS & KY
Consulting provides the opportunity to be commissioned by many clients to produce drawings of their idea or vision to be used as a visual guide during the construction process. In addition to creating sketches and construction drawings for residential and commercial properties, concept drawings for subdivisions were also provided. In Architectural drafting the primary focus was on new construction, creating drawings of buildings, their structural components and the preparation of wiring schematics used to install electrical equipment and wiring in many kinds of structures utilizing both manual drawing skills as wells as AutoCAD to create two-dimensional drawings and or three-dimensional models and renderings of the finished project. Conferring with clients, architects, and engineers helped gain an understanding of the scope and requirements of the construction project. The ability to interpret the vision of many clients and translate them into realistic drawings while following directions, paying close attention to detail on multiple projects while meeting deadlines was paramount.

Drafter and Surveying Field Assistant, June 2003  February 2004
Thomas M. Vickery Engineering and Surveying ~ Ocean Springs, MS
Civil drafting to include preparing survey drawings, assisting in boundary calculations, helping draft legal descriptions, and the generation of topographical and relief maps used to guide construction of infrastructure projects such as roads for new subdivisions, water shed and erosion control projects, and water systems. Working with architects, construction professionals and land surveyors, to ensure that site topographic conditions were adequate for construction projects and location specifications were in adherence with government laws and regulations. The ability to visualize objects, distances, and shapes with precision and being adept at using computer technology allowed me to display imagery and information in ways that could be used by professionals in other industries. As a land surveyor assistant working under the supervision of a licensed land surveyor ""walking the line"" and setting stakes or pins in places indicated, locating corner pins or other geographic indicators, clearing away brush to provide line of sight back to the instruments used by the surveyor, recording and entering data into databases, and making sketches and CAD drawings of survey sites allowed me to utilize civil drafting add-ons to AutoCAD and hone my geometry, trigonometry, problem-solving, and analytical skills.

Hiring Manager
Re: Civil Designer / CAD Technician
Dear Sir or Madam:
I was excited to see your opening for a Civil Designer / CAD Technician, and I hope to be invited for an interview.
My background includes working as a CAD Designer for Civil Engineering and Land Surveying firms. Most recently, I worked as a civil CAD Designer for a consulting engineering firm located in Vero Beach, where I was responsible for creating construction documents for various land development projects. I was involved in all aspects of projects from property research and coordinating with surveyors for collecting necessary field data to insure a successful design, to drawing conceptual layouts and final plans from which permitting, bidding and construction would be based, to construction administration including inspections, as-constructed plans and final close-out packages.
Previously, I worked at a high-volume professional Land Surveying office in Merritt Island as a Survey CAD Technician and Field Coordinator. In these positions, I demonstrated the ability to speak with clients, perform property research, assign field crew daily assignments, manage raw data files and draft surveys including Boundary, Topographic, Form-Board, Foundation, Final, Mortgage, Route, Stake-Out and As-Constructed Surveys.
I also bring to the table strong computer proficiencies in AutoCAD Land Development Desktop, MS Word, MS Excel and manual board drafting. I have the ability to produce accurate construction plans and technical bidding documents and am aware that Engineering Change Orders cause projects to go over budget. I possess an excellent understanding of AutoCAD and know how to generate 3D terrain models from survey data and draw plan and profiles, cross-sections and grading plans. Please see the accompanying resume for details of my experience and education.
I am confident that I can offer you the design ability and problem-solving skills you are seeking. Feel free to call me at 321-914-4234 (home) or 321-427-6332 (cell) to arrange an interview. Thank you for your time -- I look forward to learning more about this opportunity!

Year 2006 & 2007
I assisted in the design of a magnetic linear stator motor and brake for lifting ship elevator platform.  I also designed storage cargo racks for storing ship cargo. I made a design proposal for  36-inch diameter 125 HP deck wench for assisting in docking of the ships.  Used AutoCAD and Autodesk Inventor in all designs and checking work. I designed a six (6) spindle drill head for another company. I made 3D modal drawings from AutoCAD 2D conveyor design drawings for a costumers proposal presentation.
Year 2005 & 2006
I worked in a manufacturing shop, redlining drawings in AutoCAD and Inventor showing shop changes and sending changes to the engineering department.
Year 2004 & 2005
Using Inventor 10, I designed a vacuum belt conveyor for transferring sheets of glass thru a gas plasma flame for cleaning the glass for cell phone screens. The conveyor consisted of four belts, traveling at 28-inches per seconds, and driven by one CNC controlled servomotor.
Year 2001 thru 2004
I made concept plans of assemble workstations to assemble engines on a palletized friction roller transfer conveyors. I checked AutoCAD drawings, designed robot end effectors, and designed a CNC machine to assemble universal joints (cross tee and yoke) automatically to both ends of truck axles. We built nine machines each valued over one million dollars.
Year 1996 thru 2001
I assisted in the design of a hemming machine for manufacturing pickup truck tailgates. My contribution was inventing a method of folding the sheet metal to form the inner and outer and bottom surfaces of the tailgate, then hold the metal in this shape for hemming and welding the other three sides.  In this same period, I designed several workstations for a juice filled paper carton, production rate of 10000 cartons per hour. My major contribution was developing the flat top seal after filling the carton. I also checked welding fixtures.

I designed and developed a micro polishing machine for polishing screw leads on mining pump shafts ranging in sizes from 0.5 inch to 3.5 inch in diameter, with lengths up to 18 feet. In this same period, some of the other micro polishing machines I designed were for camshafts, faucets, knives and a 3-foot wide sheet metal stock coil-polishing machine. I worked on a container for recycling the steel particulates removed from the steel coil-polishing machine.
Year 1988 thru 1990
I designed weld-tooling fixtures. I designed a turn over welding fixture to turn over a part weighing over 40 tons in order to weld on three sides of the part. Designed an accumulating walking beam transfer for indexing car body sides 19-feet, Designed a lifter to lift the body side 5 foot of off the walking beam.
Year 1970 thru 1986
I was instrumental in developing the first of its kind, friction roller conveyor, lift and roll conveyor and motor driven quadratic drive lift and carry walking beam that both lifted and index parts in one motion from a single motor driven.

Northrop Grumman Newport News Shipyard - Planner I
Newport News, Virginia   United States
Duties: As part of the structural change management team I plan, issue and manage production schedules and coordinate with material requirements to ensure a controlled flow of approved materials timed to meet production requirements. I use SAP and internal databases to schedule these material requirements. I also advise management of the status of work in progress, material availability, and potential production problems to ensure that personnel, equipment, materials, activities and services are provided as needed. I schedule equipment and personnel, confirm material supply and demands, prepare work orders or purchase requests for the production or purchase of components or parts based on a master production schedule, shop load and inventory requirements.  My responsibilities include coordinating interdepartmental activity with quality assurance, manufacturing, purchasing, engineering, inventory control, and traffic.
6/23/2006  5/10/2010
Northrop Grumman Newport News Shipyard - Designer 2
Newport News, Virginia   United States
Duties: My responsibilities as a Designer 2 included creating technical 2D construction drawings of aircraft carrier structure. To perform this task I manipulated and verified structure in the 3D product model using CATIA V4 and DMU to ensure that my construction drawings had the correct information when delivered to downstream customers. I also worked closely with 3D modelers and structural engineers to formulate what changes needed to be made to 3D models and then generated those changes on structural technical drawings. I created PowerPoint slide shows for presentations in meetings in order to communicate needed changes.
I also maintained a working knowledge of company procedures, policies, processes, as well as, engineering practices.  I have created drawings of aircraft elevator doors, aircraft elevator platforms, structural equipment foundations and bow units. I recently led and supervised two junior designers in the development of construction drawings for my department. These projects consisted of thousands of parts and required that I was extremely organized and proactive in contacting other departments and making recommendations on how their systems should interact with ship structure.
I worked independently on many of these projects and used time management skills to ensure that drawings were issued on schedule. I am proficient in using ITS, TAS, SAP and CITRIX databases to manage my projects. I ran reports from internal databases to collect and analyze information needed to deliver a quality product on schedule.

Hampton City Schools - Substitute Teacher
Hampton, Virginia   United States
Duties: As a substitute teacher I assumed all responsibilities of a regular teacher in accordance with school rules. I maintained normal classroom routines and discipline policies. I was responsible for the safety of each child in my classroom.
6/10/2005 - 12/18/2005
Old Dominion University Gallery of Fine Arts - Intern
Norfolk, Virginia   United States
Duties: I built a public web archive of the gallery's exhibitions spanning five years.  In order to complete this project I attended a faculty development class in Dreamweaver at the Old Dominion University Center for Learning Technologies over a period of 3 months. This class acquainted me with the Dreamweaver workspace and its basic functions, cascading style sheets, templates and libraries.  I then built the web archives using photographs of previous gallery exhibitions and wrote and edited descriptions of what each exhibition entailed. I maintained design consistency with the main gallery website and easy navigation of the website.  This experience demonstrates my ability to learn and use new computer graphics software.
In addition to the web archive I built during my internship, I had a hand in the day to day management of the gallery. I arranged accommodations for visiting artists. I oversaw and executed the shipment and receipt of artwork which included contacting and making arrangements with artists concerning packing and shipping preferences.  I collaborated with artists in the hanging, setup, and lighting of exhibits.  The setup of these exhibitions ranged from hanging framed works to the arrangement of massive installation pieces.  This internship gave me valuable knowledge in how to design and prepare all the elements of an exhibit for public viewing.
I interacted with the public. I greeted visitors to the gallery and gave tours and explanations of exhibits. I maintained mailing lists for the gallery which were used to notify the public of upcoming shows and events hosted by the gallery.
4/08/2003 - 12/18/2005
Old Dominion University Print Shop - Print Shop Assistant
Norfolk, Virginia   United States
Duties: I ran the print shop and acted as assistant to the head of the art department.  I helped other students to develop concepts for their artwork and to make supply choices. I also assisted students with proper use of printing equipment and gave step by step instruction in the lithograph, screen print, and relief printing processes.
I collaborated with the professor to design and print posters publicizing the Old Dominion University Print Shop as well as offices outside of the art department.
I used Adobe Photoshop and large format laser jet printers to output separations and overlays onto clear mylar.  I also assisted my professor in researching, gathering reference material for, and designing Power Point presentations about design elements for use in classroom instruction.
I coordinated the sale and distribution of supplies for hundreds of print students at the university.  This provided me an opportunity to use my organization and customer service skills.  I also maintained the supplies, tools and equipment for the lithography, relief and screen printing areas of the shop.  I used my knowledge of carpentry and building materials to build a graining sink used for lithography and repair a rosin cabinet used for the intaglio print process.  I maintained constant verbal and written communication with professors, students and suppliers concerning scheduling, safety issues, and day to day print shop activities.
4/15/1999 - 8/15/2002
Fox Screen Print - Designer
Newport News, Virginia   United States
Duties: I created original designs for Fox Screenprint's main client, Peace Frogs.  These designs were included in the Peace Frogs product catalog.  I have also created designs for Joe's Crab Shack Restaurant, Rainforest Cafe, and Timberland as well as local organizations and small businesses.  The success of these designs was dependent on my decision making skills concerning fonts, layout, color, shading, and other design elements.
I was responsible for consulting with clients to create custom designs; this included generating original design concepts for clients' needs and collaborating with my clients to create marketing strategies based off my designs.  I provided excellent customer service by employing my superior listening and oral communication skills to gain an understanding of what a particular client needed for their product.  I brainstormed ideas and themes and developed presentations of these ideas and my design rationale along with proofs of artwork.  I used Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and CorelDraw on both Mac and PCs to create designs for clients.  I took original photographs with a digital camera and edited client photographs for use in designs composed in Adobe Photoshop.  I also created pen and pencil illustrations and drawings which I scanned for use in Adobe Illustrator or CorelDraw.
I met with clients to deliver these presentations and provided customer service by interpreting and executing any changes requested by the client.  I was additionally responsible for communicating company pricing policies to the clients. Once my designs were approved by the clients I made the designs camera ready for printing.  I am knowledgeable in CMYK and spot color separations of artwork.  After preparing color separations of designs I printed them out onto transparent vellum with a laserjet printer for printing.
I have highly developed drawing, layout, typesetting and design skills. I am proficient in using all types of scanners, lightboards, projectors, and commercial and industrial printers/plotters.","Education

I have never liked getting dirty but always admired the ability to create or design something. I have a knack for imagining how things fit together and attention to detail which is a very key part of becoming a draftsman. The application of being able to design almost any object with the aid of a computer and the AutoCAD program allows me as a drafter to input precise information and dimensions of whatever object or multiple objects that are required for any project. Growing up traveling around the world in the military with my family I was fortunate to be able to actually see many different Architectural structures and designs such as homes, buildings, statues, street designs and landscaping designs. It is my goal to be able to travel once again to other parts of the world and see some of its shapes and designs that have influenced countless of others who without the use of modern technology have created. I myself have been able to contribute what I have learned to the state I live in by assisting in projects involving Alabama state In Montgomery, Oakwood College here in Huntsville, a local real-estate firm, a medical office building and a daycare facility. I hope to be able to provide people with floor plans of existing structures and the development of new structures as well.
As a student of Drake State technical college in Huntsville, Alabama my first project was give to me by my instructor was to assist a young lady wishing to design a floor plan for a real-estate office building. All she had was a piece of paper with how long and wide the building was to be, and the placement of the interior offices and restrooms, kitchen, break room and examining rooms.  As I progressed with her design ideal, changes were made. Doors, windows, closets, columns were added as well as desks, computers, toilets, sinks, furniture and many other amenities that I could add to the project were added for visual effects. I was then near completion of her project when she mentioned that her sister was a doctor who was about to venture into the same direction that she was by designing a  new office building in Madison Alabama of which I was glad to oblige.
Just before I graduated in 2006 I was given the opportunity to work for an engineering company call Adams and Brown Services. Now I was getting paid. They gave me floor plans of new project developments at Oakwood College where I had to redesign HVAC systems from another drawing and place it into the buildings themselves. I wasnât given many dimensions but was instructed to just look at the drawing and construct it to fit in its place on the larger plans which was quite a challenge and really kind of fun. After this initial somewhat of a test I began to get work from the other projects going on in the business. I was assigned to input into a new building that was going to be constructed at Alabama State University in Montgomery, Alabama its entire plumbing system for each of the 3 or 4 floor dormitories. Using symbols, colors to indicate hot and cold water and arrows indicating water direction flow. Even so much as drain lines and their direction of flow. I added beds, work stations, fire alarm symbols, exit signs and made some minor corrections to the drawings.
Upon visiting my sister in Virginia a friend of mine from when I used to live in that city asked me to first redesign her master bedroom bathroom into one much larger than the one she already had. I was only there in the state for about 5 days so we started out with measuring how big her bathroom was now and how much larger she wanted the new design to be. We also had to determine how far into the next room it would have to go for her to get the length that she wanted. Bathroom fixtures had to be included along with the tub, shower and a double sink. I sent her a 3D image of what I was able to generate from using AutoCAD as you can see below.
As I progressed through school I was given a few more opportunities to work on other projects, one for an owner of a Day Care facility that she had just acquired. On this project I was called upon to go on site and measure each roomâs dimensions and then put the results of my measurements into the computer to develop a working floor plan with all the partitions in each room which divided activities and class groups. Behind every product, building, or process are drawings and models created by someone using the techniques and principles. If you study drafting, you'll learn the math and drawing techniques you'll need to represent three-dimensional buildings and objects. You'll not only learn to draw plans on paper. You'll also learn how to use computers. With computer-assisted drafting programs, you can make changes and add detail to your plans quickly. Increasingly sophisticated technology allows drafters to create more realistic images that almost seem like three-dimensional models, making it easy to imagine the finished structure or object. As a drafter, you'll work closely with architects, engineers, and industrial designers to interpret and relay their ideas into dimensional drawings that are used to build structures and construct an array of products.","R.B.

3DS- Donnas Drafting and Design Contracted CAD Drafter
Drafting Manager/Contractor, PACTIV Corporation, Inc., Temple TX, (Graduation to Present)
As owner of 3DS I employed 2 employees and worked with assorted contractors and engineers at PACTIV and assorted architects and other businesses.
My most recent project was to work with the R & D department at Continental Carbon Company in Houston, TX. I worked with director Marie Johnson and Randy Locke designing a leading edge new project. A Nano Extruder. The extruder project will be built and utilized for new projects funds are being raised for at present.
My duties at PACTIV  required creating and revising multiple discipline drawings in CAD 2002/2007 and other assorted software packages for 4 of their factory locations in Central TX. I was the only drafter for all project work in multiple disciplines.
(Environmental with TXDOT, Pipeline Layouts, Factory Layout Designs, P&ID, Flow Charts, Electrical, Architectural, Mechanical, Safety, Technical Illustrations)
While contracting for PACTIV I reorganized an electronic filing system with over 40K of files.
I also created file standardization for both the Temple and Corsicana plants. Along with an Excel log for existing hardcopy files and organized the Archives and backed up another 30K of drawings.
Other Freelance Drafting Projects during this time:
Dalton home (Salado)  Volney home (Temple)  Ramba home (Belton)
Wilson Elementary  (Austin)  Becker Elementary (Austin)
(This job was freelanced for Heimseth Architecture out of Austin, Texas. I was required to convert Microstation drawings to Autocad for the Austin ISD. These drawings required a great deal of updates as the .dxf conversion from Microstation to Autocad was a challenge. The final drawings were a success.

In this position I was responsible for reading customer specifications, design sketch of the vessel, thickness and pressure calculations, and shop drawings.
I also worked as a pressure vessel designer, on a contract basis, for Dupont Chemical.  My duties here were the design and detailing of large tanks, shell and tube heat exchangers, piping, and structural steel.
I worked for two years in Denver, Co. as a design draftsman, working primarily with pressure vessel design and cryogenic  vessel design.  I also worked for a short time, in Easton Pa. for a company that manufactured steam condensers for the power industry.
In my positions as a pressure vessel designer, I was involved in the mechanical and structural aspects of the equipment, such as maintenance walkways and platforms, pumps, mixers, and other various mechanical equipment.  Most of the projects that I was involved in, I was responsible for the entire project from start to finish.  This included detail drawings, sub-assemblies, and assembly drawings.
I have a fairly good knowledge of manufacturing and shop practices, especially in metal fabrication and welding.
