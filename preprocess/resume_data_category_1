should. Components fail, and operating
systems fill up with crap that hinders
performance and occasionally brings
the whole machine to a halt. Savvy
users know that they can fix most PC
problems themselves, and use sites
like www.techrepairsonline.com to find
solutions to their tech problems.
Those who lack confidence in their
tech skills, however, often fall prey
to the rapacious tactics of online and
local repair shops. Lest your local
geeks-for-hire take you for a ride (or
fleece someone you love), we've
rounded up a representative sampling
of typical repair-shop services to
help you sort the rip-offs from the
reasonable deals.In this article, I'll
explore some of the most common
offerings you'll find at repair shops
large and small. These aren't scams,
to be sure--as far as we know, these
are all legitimate services from
legitimate businesses. But the actual
value of these services--relative to
the work involved and the likely
benefit to the consumer--can be highly
questionable in many cases.
PC Tune-Ups:Just about every repair
shop I've encountered offers some kind
of ""tune-up"" service that promises to
improve your PC's performance by
deleting temporary files,
defragmenting your hard drive,
removing unused applications, running
Windows Update, and (in many cases)
cleaning the Windows Registry. These
services often cost $50 to $100, but
generally they don't do anything
useful that you couldn't do yourself
with a free download and some
utilities that come with your
PC.Before you shell out a hundred
bucks, think about what this service
entails: Windows comes with a utility
called Disk Cleanup that will delete
temporary files for you with a few
measly mouse clicks. Disk
Defragmenter--another built-in Windows
tool--typically runs automatically on
a weekly basis, but you can launch it
yourself by going to Accessories,
Utilities and clicking Defragment
Disk. Windows Update also runs
automatically by default, but you can
click Start, type Windows Update in
the search field, and run it yourself
on command.If you have a bunch of
programs you don't use, launch the
'Programs and Features' utility from
the Control Panel and weed them out by
clicking on them and selecting
Uninstall from the menu above the main
window. Or download RevoUninstaller, a
proven freebie that does a bang-up job
of pulling out all the detritus that
Windows' uninstaller often leaves
behind.As for Registry cleaners, we
recommend avoiding them entirely.
Although the premise that removing
unneeded Registry entries can speed up
your PC is basically sound, there's
little evidence that it works in
practice, and you can easily do more
harm than good when you go mucking
about in the Registry.Not counting the
time you'll spend waiting for Disk
Defragmenter and Windows Update to
automatically do their thing, the
total amount of time a relative novice
should take to perform all these tune-
up tasks is about 15 minutes. So save
your money, and check out
www.techrepairsonline.com, the best
site on the internet to guide you and
help to giveYOUR computer a
performance boost without paying for
dubious services. Dont forget to use

In May 2003, I graduated from Pace University with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in Accounting. Along with my solid academic background, I have gained exceptional hands on experience into the various aspects of the accounting profession. Assignments in my career consisted of intercompany accounting, preparing and posting month end financial close entries, full range general accounting duties, bank reconciliation, intercompany account reconciliation, balance sheet reconciliation, royalty and commission payment calculation, assisting budget process, analyze and explain monthly variances, preparing tax returns and various reports that must be filed with the SEC, performing audits and various other assignments.
My first full time accounting position was with MAP services, which is the management office to 4 restaurant establishments. Major accomplishments included, working directly with the CFO to streamline the accounting process; and convert from Excel based accounting to MAS 90 accounting program.
At Prudential Financial I managed 7 Mutual Funds. Responsibilities included performing the majority of the funds asset valuation and preparing all tax returns. Fund Accounting taught me great time management and multitasking skills.
At Wyndham Worldwide I managed a newly acquired resort. Accordingly, I built the work papers from the bottom up. I converted accounting information from the previously used program to the PeopleSoft program we used. I performed the entire gamut of general accounting and reporting for all transactions that were processed.
I enjoyed the exciting environment at A&E Television Networks. I identified reasons why royalty reporting was time consuming, and implemented ways to eliminate some of the process in order to be more efficient. I performed the full gamut of general accounting duties for A&Es Consumer Products division. A&E acquired Life Time Television at the end of 2009, which ultimately resulted in corporate down size.
I am diligent, highly organized, and responsible. Over the years I have developed into a commendable professional. I know the importance of effective communication and multitasking skills, as well as adhering to deadlines. I am confident that I would be an asset to your organization, in helping to meet its goals.
I would welcome the opportunity to discuss an accounting position with you in person. Please feel free to contact me at 201-674-3155. Thank you for reviewing my qualifications.

I Pursuit",Available upon request.,"Dear Sir or Madam:
I am actively looking for an Accountant position  As a qualified Accounting Professional, I can contribute my accounting management and financial analysis skills and experiences to your company.
I am a CGA (CPA equivalent) with a bachelor degree equivalent to US bachelor degree in accounting and have working knowledge and experience of US GAAP, Canadian GAAP, and IFRS. I am planning to get my CPA designation soon since I have a CGA designation.
As you can see from my resume, I have progressive and strong accounting experience and skills, started with full cycle accounting, journal entries, month end closing, accounts analysis and reconciliation, and progressed to internal control maintenance and development, accounting management, financial statements preparation, financial analysis and reports, budget and variance analysis, and cash flow forecast and management. I would like to convey here are the underlying traits and abilities indicated through my background:
1. Through my well-versed experience and skills with different accounting systems and advanced MS-Office skills, as well as a broad range of accounting functions and financial analysis, I am able to manage any accounting system, to use advanced MS Excel skills to create and manage any financial reports, and to make quick, well-formed decisions as issues and problems arise
2. I have strong working experience and skills in full cycle general ledger and financial statements processing and reporting. Especially, I have kept on updating my professional skills and knowledge and catch up with the latest accounting policies and changes to improve the operation and accounting processing.  Besides, I have strong research and self-study skills and am able to research work-related issues and to go over the old files to complete high quality work independently, even though there is something new at work. So I have the abilities to fit into this newly established company¡¯s working environment and catch up with any new accounting work quickly and independently
3. Since I take charge of all accounting and financial sections, I have developed excellent multi-tasking skills to manage different duties simultaneously. Especially, I am flexible to adjust work priorities to meet changing demands. Also, I am so self-started and cooperative. I can take ownership on my work and always like to take over more work or help others if I can handle it. When my managers or co-workers ask me to provide information to them, I try my best to prepare information accurately and quickly to make their work easy to do
I am looking for a company where I can continue to learn, take on additional responsibilities, contribute as much of value as I can, and grow to benefit both the company and me.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can explain my qualifications and skills in more details during the interview. I can be contacted at qunqun_zhang@hotmail.com or give me a call at (972) 302-3816.
Sincerely,
Queena Q. Zhang"

Dear Human Resources:
I am writing in search of a professional accounting position at a management level in the NW, LA area.  As my resume reflects, I have more than fifteen years of accounting experience in a manufacturing environment.  I have worked in a number of accounting positions that have allowed me to gain professional experience in the operational side of a business as well.  I am confident I can effectively perform all of the job responsibilities required within an accounting or finance department, or one specifically related to cost and operations.  My passion is in operations accounting, with focuses on team-oriented projects and process improvement implementation.
Currently, I was a Project professional for Aguirre - Roden Incorporated a Architect company. My primary duties include preparing all financial statements and presenting variance analysis to corporate finance.  I work closely with the Controller on a daily basis, providing him with key performance indicators and suggestions for implementing process improvements within operations.  I attend daily production meetings and inform management on performance issues as well.  I recently prepared and submitted our 2009 budget, and performed and submitted cost justifications for potential capital investments.  Since being employed, I have implemented an internal control process for accounting functions, and worked with corporate to correct GL interface allocations for all divisions of the company.
In my most recent employment history, I was the Senior Accountant for Robert Half Management Resources Inc. doing multiple companies contract/consulting projects.  Most of these companies needed custom specialty accounting skills to comply with there corporate accounting demands. I prepared all journal entries for accruals, inter-company transactions, and intra-divisional transfers of expenses, cost price analysis, and budgeting plan set up, inventory reconciliations, multiple companies accounting software implementations inclusive of Solomon-IV ERP, Platinum ERP, MAS-200 ERP, Macola ERP, People Soft ERP,  as well as SOX Compliance Remediation assistance.  I was also responsible for overseeing monthly and year end journal entry transactions for cost and inventory, accounts payable, accounts receivable, and payroll.
In addition to the above duties, I also prepared and published all financial statements both at an entity level and a consolidated level, and I submitted these numbers to the corporate office through corporate compliance mandates as required for reporting constraints. I also coordinated Controllable Expense Analysis Reporting for multiple companies departments, comparing spending to budget, forecasts, and prior year plans.  I completed analysis on monthly statistics and published reports that contained statistics including on-time delivery, Departmental Sales Order, Department Purchase Order, and inventory turns.  These reports were all published to upper management and staff, inclusive of the Controller, V.P. of Finance and the Divisional President as well as local Auditors.
Prior to being promoted to the Accounting Manager, I was hired by Transportation Manufacturing Corporation as a Senior Cost Accountant.  I was responsible for maintaining the cost system, which included verification of bills of materials, routers, and the correct calculation of each.  I worked closely with our product and process engineers to establish standardized bills of materials and routers to simplify the costing system and ensure cost and inventory accuracy.  I also worked very closely with project managers to calculate cost justifications for major expenses and capital expenditures.  Once a project was approved, I tracked spending and maintained capital asset information, including the calculation of depreciation and amortization.
Another major responsibility in this position was overseeing our semi-annual physical inventories.  I was the champion of all functions concerning our physical counts including all scheduling of personnel, pre-inventory meetings, training, and clearing of all areas.  I worked very closely with operations management to ensure accurate counts and resolve discrepancy issues.  I conducted post-inventory meetings and led teams to address all absolute variances in our results.
I also have several years experience in Accounts Receivable, including special training in successful collection techniques.  I have a proven track record of positively impacting the Departmental Sales Order and maintaining a past due AR of less than 2%, which I credit mostly to my communication and negotiating skills.  I have experience dealing with high-risk accounts and maintaining reasonable credit limits.  I conducted annual analysis of customer financial status including analyzing Dunn and Bradstreet Reports as well as 10Q and 10k filings on our public customers.
My career goal includes finding a position that allows me to work closely with the operations side of a manufacturing company.  Within the next 10 years I would like to move into an operations management role and utilize my financial knowledge in the operation environment for the benefit of the company.  I am considering a career change to your company primarily due to the fact that the position you are offering fits with my passion and goal.
In closing, I am a very confident, professional individual that maintains a high level of ethics in everything I do.  I take pride in all of my work, large or small.  I am a team player that has the ability to either lead a team or participate at the necessary level as support.  I thrive on challenges and am not afraid to take necessary risks to get the job done.  It would be an honor to be considered for this position.
Sincerely,
Rick Stratton
