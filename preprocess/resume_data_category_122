On Wednesday night, we hosted an outdoor party in the backyard for our dear friends Alison and Ty who are set to get wedding this coming weekend. It was a gorgeous night. It was warm and not too hot, but when dusk set, mosquitoes started to show up.
""I usually bring bug spray,"" one of the guests who was sputtering and fled into the kitchen. I tried to find evidence that would confirm the legend The closest I could get to the real facts was on
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lily-plant-identification/id1570145257
."" Of course this time, I'm not carrying. I'm being eaten alive in the wild!""
I considered the explanation of the vipassana theory of Elizabeth Gilbert's mediation theory on mosquito tolerance but I thought that he would not be interested.
As the majority of the guests departed The four of us who were hosting the event, guests of honor as well as one of their companions were seated in a circle in the garden with tiki torchlights. With the flames and bugs, it was like a scene from Survivor.
Intoxicated by sangria, decided to see if it was possible to kill a mosquito by filling it to the top with blood. I've heard of this for a long time but I've not had the courage or the courage or even the sanity to try it.
A massive mosquito bit my forearm on the right side. I noticed the sucker's proboscis penetrate my skin. I breathed in deeply, and then squeezed the muscle inside my forearms as hard as I could. I threw my skin over the insect in order to bring more blood into it.
The abdomen of the mosquito swelled up the hind legs were lifted off my arms, flailing across the sky. The rest of the guests were cheering. ""This is a moment made for YouTube!"" was the chant of one guest. He during his normal day life is actually a respectable University of Iowa professor.
Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately) nobody had a video camera on hand.
At the exact moment I was worried that the bug might explode and fly away, it swung it's head, releasing a powerful squeeze and flew away with a little wobbling up in the air. However, within 45 seconds, it came back to resurface but this time, it hit my right upper bicep. Alison who was in the chair with me was able to confirm that this was exact.
""Go ahead and squeeze,"" I shouted. ""Grab my arm!""
I stretched, and she grabbed my bicep with all the force she could. Once more, the bulging bug flew from my arm, this time, it climbed up to the point that all of its legs were swaying freely. The only thing that connected it to my arm was sucking through the proboscis.
I flexed harder. Alison squeezed harder. A patient yelled that she could see the monster expanding.
Then, again it pulled back, perhaps trying to determine the reason it had given as a meal. It vanished into the night carrying the blood of my body with it. The following day my right arm was covered with four blue-colored bruises on each side of the area where the mosquito bit me. For now, I'm simply applying insect repellent. Guerrilla tactics don't work.","How To Transfer Money From Netspend To Cash App In No Time?

I developed the team from 5 representatives to 24 while servicing carrier and distribution customers.  I took the team through system implementations and assisted with the design of the new phone system.  During my time managing the customer service team I also created the ELITE Services team to focus on specialty customers.  At the same time, in a dual reporting role, I was supporting distribution customer implementation.   This opportunity gave me the experience and knowledge to determine that I wanted to move from Operations to Sales.
In moving to Sales I did work remotely and supported two Sales Executives with their carrier and distribution customers.  On special assignment for 6 months I was asked to go back to the service center to manage the ELITE team to re-engineer their purpose and hire the Manager who would eventually take over the team.   I accomplished this assignment and then was assigned to work on the Customer Experience Team as an Account Manager.  I did work very closely with IT, Operations and Sales to ensure the customers needs were met.  My knowledge of all systems and procedures was critical because I tested system enhancements, submitted program change requests and was the customer advocate in distribution.  I also worked with outside vendors (iPipeline, SmartOffice, Paperclip, Vamdb) to understand their system capabilities and how they integrated with Portamedic.  This knowledge gave me the tools to teach field sales representatives and also train customers new to Portamedic. As a result, I have an unusual talent for turning challenges into solutions that can yield profitable results.
At this time, in searching for another position, it is clear that the Account Manager title should have been Customer Experience or Customer Success Manager.  This is the role that mirrors the responsibilities that I performed daily with customers.
I'm always happy to roll up my sleeves to learn new skills to get the job done.  As your business grows I would appreciate your consideration in having me join your team.","Executive Director, The Maryland Foster

manager, I have great experience, knowledge,
and skills to bring to any company in any
industry. With almost two decades of
experience as a business development
manager, I am excellent at directing projects
and building consensus. I also have extensive
knowledge and experience in the areas of
travel/hotel, recruitment/staffing, and human
resources.
Because I can easily throw myself into learning
a new industry, I am adept at moving into areas
where Ive not previously had experience. I have
been successful in the past by quickly learning
the hotel industry. I acted as liaison between a
hotel developer in Columbia and the Wyndham
Hotel chain headquartered in New Jersey, USA.
In addition, I have experience boosting profits,
improving processes, and reducing costs in
every position I have ever held. I have the skill
to see the big picture, yet work within the
detailed areas necessary to advance projects. I
am able to quickly identify areas that need more
attention and focus on multiple priorities without
losing control. I maintain the vision that
achieves the specific, major goals.
I am interested in pursuing opportunities in
areas where I already have experience and
knowledge, but I would welcome the prospect
of project or business development
opportunities in the entertainment industry,
museum, and cultural industries.
As a business development manager I can work
in almost any industry. All the projects Ive led I
had to start from the basics and learn the
industry. I have had great success in the hotel
industry, international recruiting and staffing,
and as an entrepreneur.
I have extensive international experience. I have
worked and studied abroad. In the recent past I
have travelled extensively for my own pleasure
and edification. I fluently read, write, and speak

professional experiences to each new
opportunity.","Veteran of the U.S. Army.  Anticipate completion of BS in Business Administration/management in August of 2013.  Looking to relocate to the San Antonio, TX area.","To Whom It May Concern:

My experience reflects the necessary people and sales skills, marketing and business development expertise that will bring the desired results to your organization. I have an innate sense and passion for business development as well as the ability to see and keep in mind the key factors related to operating a cost-efficient business.

I am extremely organized, proficient in Microsoft Office programs, and an energetic and a hardworking team player. My professional career skills and training would easily transfer to this position.
In 2007 I decided to broaden my career path from strictly management and special event fundraising to assisting individuals with special physical and emotional needs. Recently I was an Assistant Residential Manager for Amego, an agency for individuals who are predominately on the autism spectrum. At Amego I was responsible for the childrens medical and health information, financial records, recreational, nutrition, residential budget management, and supervising a dozen direct care staff with around the clock care. Prior to Amego, I worked for the Horace Mann Educational Association as Direct Care and as Residential Manager. While at HMEA I worked with a diverse adult population of individuals with various developmental health issues and intellectual disabilities. As a residential manager I was responsible for the clients dietary and medical needs, balancing individual and house budgets, and supervising the staff.
Before coming to the field of human services, I worked in marketing, fundraising and development for a number of nonprofit agencies. During those years I had the opportunity to work with several organizations, and gained a unique perspective of the development profession; coordinating a variety of special events, grant writing and directed appeals. Whether I was working at a large and well established institution like Brown University or a smaller start up school like Sophia Academy, I have worked diligently to build a broad base of progressive career experiences. In 2003, I decided to leave my development profession so that I could care for my grandmother who had Alzheimers, and assisted with the care of my dying father.

Responsibilities:
Train dogs both privately and in groups, sell

Accomplishments:
During my employment with Petco, I earned my

from how many people I could sign up a day for
rewards programs to the highest amount of
money collected for needy pets in the Branson,
Missouri area. I also trained fellow employees on
how to best convince customers of products,
programs, and training classes during my
employment with Petco. My managers could
always count on me to show new associates how
to run the front of the store and give top notch
customer service.
Sales/Retail:  I expanded my ability to
communicate better with people and earn their
trust very quickly. I always gave the best advice
when it came it pet care and customers knew to
come looking for me when they had a question or
problem.
Cashier/barista (soda tender)/hostess
Dixie Cafe - Jonesboro, AR
October 2005 to July 2009
Responsibilities
Greet guests, seat guests, run register,make
desserts and drinks, answer
telephone, run food, clean tables and carry out
orders
Accomplishments
I was the best hostess they ever had. I was
excellent at dividing tables
and predicting turn overs. I always worked peak
shifts (busiest times
such as Sundays and Mother's Day). I also
produced the prettiest desserts
and drinks because I had so much experience
making them prior to my job
at Dixie Cafe.
I also trained every new hire how to properly host
(meaning how to follow
the seating chart while using their best
judgement) and also how to give
outstanding customer service.
I was a highly valued member of their team until I
had to quit to go to
school full time.
Skills Used
Top notch customer service- you will never meet
a person nicer to guests
than myself
Leadership- I conducted all the seating
arrangements and directed the
servers and busboys where to go next.
Barista skills-Prior to being a hostess, I spent my
whole life making
espresso drinks. I grew up in a home where
coffee was important and we
had our full size espresso machine, steamer and
grinder. My parents
taught me everything I know about coffee; it is a
passion of ours. Three
of those years prior to working at Dixie Cafe, I
worked in two different
coffee shops in the area.
I have loads of experience up-selling cafe
products such as pie, cookies,
candy etc.
I do very well as a multi-tasker as well. I can make
drinks, greet guests
and take orders all at once.
Barista
Coffee Gallery/Club Tan - Jonesboro, AR
May 2005 to October 2005
Responsibilities
Make espresso drinks, blended drinks, desserts
(chocolates and fudge were
something new I had to learn to make), answer
drive thru window, run
register, bus tables, clean tanning beds, restock
supplies and shelve
products.
Accomplishments
I taught all of their new hires how to correctly
make espresso drinks. I
also trained new employees in proper customer
service for greeting
guests, answering phones, and polite small talk
with guests while
working.
Skills Used
Coffee and dessert making- Like I said before, I
have been making
espresso ever since I can remember but my
beautiful dessert creations are
absolutely inspired by my time working at Coffee
Gallery. My drinks and
desserts are like masterpieces in the Cafe World.
Register- This was a very fast paced environment
that could get very
hectic very quickly. I remember that my awesome
register skills were
really put to the test with that Drive Thru window
they installed, but I
have always been up for a challenge.
Multi-tasking skills- I was running that register,
answering phones,
making drinks, preparing dessert ingredients, and
cleaning tanning beds.
There was never a dull moment nor was I ever
standing idle behind that
bar.
Receptionist
Skyventure Aviation - Jonesboro, AR
September 2003 to October 2005
Responsibilities
Greeted clients, answered the phones, offered
drinks and snacks to
clients, booked lessons and airplane rentals,
produced invoices using
Quickbooks, and handled payments.
Accomplishments
This was my first job ever. I was 14 years old and
a freshman in high
school when I began working for my father part
time as one of his
receptionists at his newly opened flight school. I
learned how to use all
sorts of software including Quickbooks,
WordPerfect, PowerPoint,
Spreadsheet and Adobe. I also learned how to
cashier, process credit card
transactions, schedule appointments for others,
and how to open and close
a store alone.
Skills Used
Customer service- I really stood out in the
workplace because I was so
young, so I learned to act older than I really was
by demonstrating work
ethic and customer service someone twice my
age would have shown. I
enjoyed impressing people with my sharp
communication skills and
conversation techniques.
Computer skills- In high school it is a requirement
to know how to use
all of the software I listed above (with the
exception of Quickbooks)
before you start 10th grade. I found myself
training the other employees
and business partners how to use their own
computers at work.
This was a great learning experience for me when
I was in high school.
Barista
Cafe Java - Paragould, AR
October 2004 to May 2005
Responsibilities

Accomplishments
I trained new hires on how to correctly make
espresso drinks and how to
properly treat customers.
I also planted and tended to their flowers they had
in front of their
store.
Skills Used
Coffee and general cafe knowledge- I put my

Due to my own doings I have made a huge mistake in the course of my life which has cost me the job I loved for 23 years and current jobs that cannot have a felony conviction. It would be so easy just to give up, but I cannot do that. I know it's going to be very difficult for any employer to even think about hiring me due to my past mistake, but I will not give up.  Over the last year I have beat myself up wishing I could change the past, undue what I've done, but it does not work that way.  Today and going forward is the only thing I can change and control.  I know I can make a difference in the world in a good way.  Currently I live in Illinois, I would be willing to relocate for the right position.  My email address is amd4611@aol.com.

Solution-based, research oriented professional that has created value for customers and client partners
Managed the purchase of a 27 million dollar a year floor covering company from its parent company and was an integral part of a team that secured a revolving line of credit of up to 5 million dollars with limited covenants; Negotiated discounts and rebates with various vendors throughout the floor covering industry; Recommended and implemented AP policies that took advantage of these discounts and rebates. Result:  Added over 10% profit to the bottom line.
Analyzed in real dollars what the parent company had not been taking advantage of terms or discounts as offered by the mills.  The cost was roughly 800k annually that the parent company was missing out on in terms, plus an additional 200k in rebates. Aggressively negotiated discounts and rebates and communicated a new accounts payables policy to our team.  Result:  Increased roughly 1 million dollars in net income to the bottom line in 2008.
Developed and implemented procedures and policies that encouraged the AR team to send out statements every two weeks as well as outstanding invoices to increase the rate of cash flow. The cost was roughly 120k annualized resulting in the ability to save for additional capital purchases; Created a contact sheet for the sales staff to get email addresses for property managers and managers of REITS to get problems resolved at the property level or at the management company level. Result: The impact was roughly 60k annualized after all costs are taken into consideration.
Communicated and negotiated with LA Fiber to recycle all of used carpet and pad.  The problem was that carpet could be recycled, yet the plants were not recycling at the capacity they could, so the situation needed to be looked at from the position of the end user.  The cost was approximately $ 300 per 40 yd roll off in Phoenix.  In other markets, the cost ranged anywhere from $450 to $600 per roll off. Negotiated a deal with Fed Ex and LA Fiber where Fed Ex would pick up a 55' trailer and take it back to LA for $ 150;  Instituted on a trial basis in the Phoenix market for 2 months to before rolling it out through the rest of the markets. Result: Increased profits by 200k.
Created a spread sheet and illustrated to team members all of the costs involved (materials, administration, time, fuel, additional labor and loss of profit), developed a tracking system for management to track the root cause of inaccurate record keeping.  This made the customer happy as well as created less work for the company. Result: Approximately 120k savings annualized.
Recommended inventory be sold on a FIFO basis instead of just being sold randomly.  This started cleaning up the aged inventory immediately from an ""item"" stand point, thus reducing carrying costs and administrative costs. Suggested to CEO a special sales to websites such as craigslist, which was no cost to do, also donated much of the aged inventory to Habitat for Humanity.

Within several months time, I was hearing reports from company management of an increased amount in phone inquiries, webinar and trade show attendance, and an increased request for product information.
My work experience has honed my skill as a savvy, detailed-oriented marketing professional, whos firmly capable of wearing the hat Jack of All Trades.  I feel equally secure creating attention-grabbing marketing content and graphics in the office, as well as, driving marketing campaigns through blog websites, webinars, joint partnership efforts, print/ online advertisement, and industry shows.",,Available upon request.

BLACK BELT IN SALES FORCE OPTIMIZATION
Sales Force Optimization
When reading resumes, you see the same Blah Blah Blah on most other resumes  except this resume shows someone who is a specialist for one function:  Delivering results by specific sequential means.  This is the singular reason why you must have me on your team: To deliver replicable designs for managed revenue and greater profits.
The unparalleled focus of my professionalism is Sales Force Optimization (SFO).  SFO incorporates many disciplines, assets at hand, and current methodologies to generate the most effective, efficient, and ethical design for bottom-line results; yielding total Sales Force Optimization.  In a start-up or more mature environment, SFO is greater efficiency and more significant results.
SFO is a multifaceted approach beginning with recruiting the strongest talent; then fully arming them with great depth in sales skills and product/service knowledge.  Dovetailing this with a highly delineated set of Quadra-Goals for the many facets of success; reviewed at least weekly by the salesperson and at least monthly by the direct supervisor; more often if remediation is required.
The two professions most aligned in having predefined highly specific metrics applied to ascertain quantitative success are sports professionals and sales people.  Only nebulous and ambivalent yardsticks are utilized in determining the best accountant, physician, or attorney.  A great salesperson knows every week or month where they stand versus a highly specific set of goals.  Moving all the salespeople expeditiously to where the company needs them to be mandates the implementation of SFO; my singular specialty; focused as if it was the pointed end of a laser beam with the concentration on SFO.
With this must get it right hire for this key position, contributing to new business development and increased account penetration; this Black Belt in SFO, creating successful results, functionally innovative, will afford you the Sales Force Optimization you have long struggled to obtain.
If you remember just one thing from when we meet, remember my professional DNA: L. U. N.   Laser Focused.  Unwavering Ethics.  No Excuses.
When you call, we can discuss how your sales needs, your profit expectations, and my SFO strategies will deliver the results you must have.  Thank you.

I am writing to express my sincere interest in employment in your organization.  I grew up in the Indianapolis area and I am committed to returning to the area now that I have completed my education. Attached you will find a complete resume outlining my professional qualifications and experiences for your evaluation and consideration.
I am a December 2010 graduate of Pace University¡¦s Lubin School of Business, with a Bachelor¡¦s degree in Business Administration.  I am educated in everything from accounting to marketing in the business world.  Majoring in Business Management provides a comprehensive and well-rounded business education, so I am quite versatile.  My concentration within Business Management was entrepreneurship, so I am a very creative thinker and highly self-motivated.  My years of experience working within the community has helped me acquire other attributes like patience, and concern for others and the environment.  I am hardworking, determined, driven, confident and have a clear vision of what I want to accomplish in the future.  I will be very passionate towards any organization that gives me a chance to prove myself and excel.  I am guided by the same values that drive any good potential leader: Excellence, Integrity, Empowerment, Responsibility, and Vision.  I am also a quick learner, take direction very well and have demonstrated that I have the skills to be an effective leader.
While completing my education, I held several jobs which helped to give me real world business skills and more importantly gave me a better understanding of the relevance of the concepts I was learning in class:
•	In my experience working for JP Morgan Chase I have acquired and sharpened many skills. My customer relation and sales experience have been strengthened through face-to-face interactions with the customers and making referrals to bankers for services that the bank offers. Counting and handling large amounts of cash on a daily basis requires a proven responsibility and attentive to detail
•	The experience I received working for Swiss Post Solutions at the investment bank Barclay¡¦s Capital was a valuable introduction to large corporate financial institutions.  Most of the experience I gained at this company revolved around the customer service aspect of investment banking including being responsible for the needs of out-of-town clients.  The position I held was effectively an assistant manager, which involved the management and direction of others on the team.
•	Working for Yorktown Golf and Baseball has given me good experience in managing employees and had overall responsibility for the operation of the business during my shift.  For over three years I was responsible for managing two employees per shift, dealing with cash and credit transactions, counting out the drawer, and preparing a nightly count out sheet and bank deposit.
Through these experiences,    I have gained valuable people skills through my interactions with clients, customers and those I have helped on my own time.  I¡¦m a responsible and dependable worker with strong sense of morality and ethics.
I feel that I have an advantage over other entry level candidates because of my maturity and life experience.  My passion and enthusiasm to learn will make me a valuable asset to your organization.  I hope after reviewing my resume you will give me the opportunity to meet in person with you or a company representative. I am confident that you will be favorably impressed with what I have to offer.

Russell Etling has created dynamic new visions and provided solid direction for the projects and institutions that he has guided.  He has also devoted his career to creating exciting, educational and uplifting audience experiences on a variety of platforms. His broad set of skills come from his experiences: leading both non-profit and for-profit companies; developing interpretive exhibitions and media; producing and managing events for live audiences; and securing resources for, advocating and marketing his products to multiple constituencies.  He is also known as an enthusiastic and persuasive spokesperson for the endeavors he represents.
Organizational Management
In 1986, as part of his own companys management consulting services, Mr. Etling served as General Manager for the historic Hyde Park Festival Theatres all-star summer season.  In 1988, he joined the Miami Museum of Science as an Interim Director following a significant management transition at the institution.  What began as a six-month consulting contract ultimately extended to a fourteen-year association, with Etling soon serving as the Museums permanent Executive Director and later President and CEO (1988-2002).  During his tenure, the Museum was accredited by the American Association of Museums and grew its budget from $1.8 to $6.5 million.  It also became: one of the first Affiliates of the Smithsonian Institution; a national leader training teachers in technology and mentoring low-income youth; and a regional resource for environmental education and the ecological research, rehabilitation and release of injured birds of prey.
Visioning for the Future and Strategic Planning
Throughout his career, Russell Etling has been known for his ability to mold bold new visions for the projects that he undertakes.  During his tenure he directed the Miami Museum of Sciences multi-year planning initiative to create a world-class facility as part of downtown Miamis urban and waterfront redevelopment program.  To that end, he spearheaded the Museums pioneering affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution, the nations museum.  He was also principal author of the new museum projects case for support and helped direct the bond-issue campaign that secured its site in Bicentennial Park on Biscayne Bay.  At the Executive Board or Director level, he has participated in multi-year, professionally facilitated strategic planning initiatives for the Association of Science-Technology Centers, Orange Bowl Committee and Miami Museum of Science.
Resource Development, Advocacy, and Marketing
Etling has a long history of fostering support and cultivating funding from the public and private sectors for the projects he has guided.  He has been integrally involved in the development of many successful government (Local, State and Federal), corporate and foundation grants.  He has spent years lobbying support from City, County, State and Federal elected leadership.  Working closely
with marketing and media production staff, Mr. Etling has always taken an active role in the imaging, graphic design, marketing and promotion of the projects he represents.
Exhibition Development
Etling has directed the development and/or presentation of dozens of featured, permanent and traveling exhibitions on art and design, history, archaeology, physical science and natural history.  Cultivating and directing talented teams of curators, educators, designers and fabricators, he leverages his background as a producer, director and production coordinator to foster innovation, understanding and entertainment in the exhibit projects that he undertakes.
In recent years, the Russell Etling Company produced a major traveling exhibition featuring 1st Empire authority and author Pierre-Jean Chalençons world-class collection of art and artifacts largely dominated by pieces that were the personal possession of Napoléon Bonaparte, his family or members of his Imperial Court.  NAPOLÉON opened September 2005 at the National Geographic Museum in Washington, DC and is soon concluding its tour of important American museums. For his educational efforts with this project, he was inducted as an Honorary Fellow of Florida State Universitys Institute of Napoleon and the French Revolution. See: www.napoleonexhibit.com
Production and Promotion
With a Fine Arts Degree in Theatre Management as background, Etlings early career included three years as a stage manager for Walt Disney Productions (1979-1980) and three years for the Shaklee Corporations Incentive Convention Shows (1980-1982).  Becoming President of Etling Productions (1983-1988), he produced and directed a halftime spectacular for national television, promoted stadium concerts, staged numerous major fundraising events and, for four years, was production manager and lighting director for Perry Comos national concert tours.  A member of the Actors' Equity Association since 1980, Russell Etling has produced, stage-managed or appeared in over 1,500 live performances with many of the greatest performers of the 20th Century.","Highly competent and dedicated

- Leadership  community outreach, public speaking, organization and education.
Management  Influenced and optimized people to meet objectives
Focus  efforts always stay targeted at what will increase income and reduce company costs.","To Whom it May Concern:
Based on my training, work experience, and personal skills, I would like to be considered for a business related position in your organization.
My business training consists primarily of five years of study at the Santa Maria University in Venezuela where I received my bachelors degree in Business Administration.   I am currently pursuing my Master of Business Administration degree at the University of Louisiana at Monroe and plan to finish in May 2011.  Both the undergraduate and the Master of Business Administration courses have given me a good foundation of business knowledge.  As a general business major, I have studied functional fields such as management, marketing, information systems, finance, and accounting, as well as other core business subjects.  My broad experience in direct sales and international sales management contributes to my real-world training and exceptional communication skills.
Since quality and excellence is undoubtedly important to businesses, I ask that you examine my record of both work experience and academic achievement.  You will find that I take my studies seriously, with a 3.98 GPA, which put me at the top of my graduating class.  This sort of excellence is also reflected in my record of work at the Xerox Company in Venezuela, where I excelled in specialized sales and took leadership roles in sales projects. I assure you that I will bring this work ethic and attitude to my duties.
Throughout college, both undergraduate and graduate, I have devoted time to the development of my personal skills.  I participated in community service in Venezuela where I focused on improvement of local neighborhood economic growth and I currently am an active member of the University of Louisiana MBA association.  These experiences have helped me to find the balance and attitude that you seek and value in your new employees.
These highlights and other evidence in the enclosed résumé present my case for full time job.  I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience.  You can reach me at 318-381-5511 or at andres_g73@hotmail.com.  I would appreciate the opportunity to serve you.
Sincerely,

Prospective Employer,
If you are seeking a honest, dedicated, energetic,
tireless, self starter, detailed oriented, service
driven, people person who is proven in increasing
sales, motivating people, closing & maintaining
those sales, I maybe your man so read on.
As a road warrior, I am looking for less time away
from home. I have proven abilities in retaining
customers, solving problems, working as a team
player and managing people in the field or at a
customer training session.  I have used power
points and/or MS Office software, prepared color
manuals and have conducted numerous seminars
on various topics.
I believe New Sales Calls are the key here whether it
be a small business owner, corporation or board of
directors, and I have called on them all.  Following a
lead or cold call I can usually develop an interest for
additional calls to review a potential clients
services, perform a plant audit or even to solve
some of their current problems and/or to evaluate if
I/we want to proceed.  Is it a win win for all and is
the time needed worth our investment?  There are
some customers I do not want as customers too.
I usually like to tackle their toughest problem, get
our foot in the door, prove ourselves and what we
can do, and then expand to include the entire plant,
business or facility.  In one account I increased
annual sales from $193,426 to $430,788 the
following year and then to $988.617 the year after
that! Simply by monitoring usage, service,
expanding and finding the correct products for
those applications including monitoring equipment,
training and paying attention to details.
For the past 20+ years I have been in the light
commercial, industrial, & institutional markets
selling AND servicing water treatment accounts
including cooling towers, boilers, cleaning &
sanitation and wastewater for various industries.
Like industrial plants, large manufacturing
dairies/butter/cheese plants, hospitals, office
buildings, multiple libraries and multiple state
manufacturing corporations in the Western United
States including CA, NV, TX, UT, NM, & AZ.
I have been trained to hire, train, motivate and
inspire a sales force of up to 60 people in direct
face to face selling also in the Western United States
including ID, UT, NV, & WY.   Because of the highly
motivated road warrior sales individual I have
become I know these Western States and cities very
well because I have sold to, & trained people to sell
to a variety of business there usually face to face.
Selling is just part of what I do.  Servicing and
retaining these customers is also important to me.
Most of my customers become good friends and
rely on me for honest and true information on
current prices, procedures and consultations for
their considerations.
I am computer and technology literate.  I have
installed set up & serviced literally hundreds of
controllers at plants or business that can monitor
systems, send email or text messages for my or
managers cell phones for immediate action.  I have
installed or replaced various equipment, aided
customers in chemical cleanings and descales.  I am
not afraid to get dirty and am usually a hands on
person but can delegate and train when necessary.
If you are interested in bringing aboard a person
you can count on and trust to get the job done with
little or no supervision, when trained on your
products and procedures, you should call me right
away and arrange an interview for further
evaluation.  Thanks again,  David","My Name is Frank James.

Human Resources Department:
I would like to be considered for a full-time Management position. Prior to my retirement this September, I had been employed with United Parcel Service for the past thirty-two years. During that period I prepared for retirement by attending college and earning two degrees. I have a masterâs degree in economics as well as a bachelorâs degree in secondary education.
In addition to being a full-time driver, I chaired the companyâs safety committee. We met bi monthly to discuss and analyze safety related data, prepared reports and graphs to explain trends and results, and concluded with oral presentations at morning pre-trip meetings. I used my delivery contacts to generate new accounts increasing sales volume on my area by ten percent. I helped recruit, organize, and train seasonal hires to ensure a smooth transition throughout our peak holiday delivery season. I have excellent computer and software application skills. As a requirement for graduation, I worked a fifteen week economic internship for Mol-Mec Industries in Walled Lake. I worked with their management team learning cost analysis and budget forecasting.
I have served on the Lakes Area Association board enacting legislation committed to the preservation and enjoyment of Walled Lake. We held ice shanty owners accountable by requiring the daily removal of all structures and equipment. We distributed fliers educating residents on the use of fertilizer and pesticides. Currently, I am arguing against the City of Noviâs proposed chemical weed management control program while proposing non-chemical successful alternatives.
I have thirty years in the delivery/sales business. I have experience in the logistics, sense of urgency, focus to detail, and customer retention and development in a fast moving competitive industry.
I am currently employed by the South Lyon School District as a substitute teacher.
I appreciate your taking the time to review my qualifications and experience. Again, thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Andrew R. Soborowski",,,

I started artiscraft in 2003 and in the following years I managed the growth of the company as we became a well regarded design/build company in Kelowna.  I was the managing partner and was responsible for office functions and yard operations, business development, site & project sourcing, contract & project management, plus coordinating all consultants.  My duties included developing proformas that projected costs, revenues and ROI for numerous proposals and setting up schedules for our proposals and projects.  I also facilitated our designation as one of the first Built Green registered companies in the Okanagan and incorporated UBCs R.E.A.P. green policy guidelines into a ski resort proposal.  I managed projects and supervised much of the works on-site, coordinating logistics & staff and managing the work of our subcontractors.  I also started NPM Projects with a partner from Vancouver for out-of-town projects where we supplied project management services and I coordinated a joint venture project with an Alberta-based development company.
1994 - 2003   Okanagan Scaffold & Shoring / Skyway Canada
I opened the first scaffold, shoring & formwork company in the Interior of BC, which proved to be quite successful in a short period of time. Our product line included concrete accessories, swing-stages, access scaffold, shoring & formwork systems.  We delivered, installed & tore down our systems on hundreds of projects, working with general contractors utilizing cranes & lift trucks on-site.  A major source of our success was in promoting our various products & services to a client so that one product/service could generate leads for our other product & services, in order to become a one-stop shop for our customers.
Okanagan Scaffolds market share of the Interior regions of BC reached saturation point by 1998 (we also supplied customers in Vancouver and Vancouver Island through Eagle Scaffolding).  I then opened a branch in Calgary and by the end of 1999 our success reached the point where we became widely known in Alberta as a well-run and profitable company.  We thus attracted the attention of Skyway Canada, which had a branch and dealer network based out of Toronto, had opened a branch in Edmonton and was looking for a business partner in Calgary.  Skyway found Okanagan Scaffold's performance to be outstanding and the companies merged with me becoming a partner in Skyway and managing the Calgary and Kelowna branches.  I set-up a new location for the expanded operations in Calgary and incorporated a newly acquired swing-stage company into our Calgary, Kelowna and Edmonton branches.  I was involved in corporate and branch budgeting, sales forecasts, planning and acquiring new or improved product lines, corporate hiring, training and development, and participated in the sourcing and integration of a nation-wide database and accounting system.
1990 - 1994    Community Planner
I worked with several communities in the Okanagan Region as a Planner and gained much experience in dealing with the unique social & municipal structures within individual communities.  To provide a community with plans, I had to investigate the core values of each community and what made each city tick.  I developed a database system for municipal use to track applications and projects in the pipeline of the planning and business licensing departments; GIS strategies were also incorporated to assist staff planning functions and for public utilization.  Working as a Community Planner provided me with municipal regulatory experience, with duties that included public presentations, working with municipal and regional district staff and politicians. I also worked as the manager of the Community Futures Program funding public requests for programs that provided benefits to the local community.  I worked with community groups, staff and politicians in the Okanagan in facilitating public meetings and surveys, analyzing community group requests for funding and making funding recommendations to the Community Futures board.

Madam, Sir:
Since finishing college, my career includes over 10 years of sales related experience in a variety of business development, account management and customer service roles. I led two of my previous employers in sales in my first full calendar year of employment. I have also organized and performed presentations at renowned tradeshows including Comdex, Brainshare and Networld Interop. I am Microsoft and Comptia certified as a computer / network engineer.
For the last few years I have been a Quality Engineer at an aerospace / integrated component distributor. While managing ISO audits and maintaining a quality management system, my sales and marketing experience was an asset with my responsibilities and performance in consulting with our sales staff. In the fall of 2009 I obtained an IPA Business Management certification (the renowned Harvard School of Business uses IPAs business model for their MBA program).
I am interested in finding employment in a business development, customer service or related field again. I feel that my strongest attributes are my attention to detail, my ability to communicate and display leadership in fast paced, high pressure situations. I am a quick study, proficient in multi-tasking and I would enjoy the challenge of working in a new environment. Your Consideration is most appreciated.
Regards,
Stephen Youngquist

Ive come to understand the challenges people face in their financial lives and how to overcome them and provide the peace of mind that comes from knowing that their financial life is on track. I understand the importance of communicating using simple, non-technical terms and concepts that empower clients to make decisions that best meet their needs.
As an owner / operator of a successful small business for ten years, I had the responsibility of day-to-day operations, P&L management, new business development and long-term strategic planning. My project management experience was crucial to ensuring the timely completion of each months deadline driven product delivery and overall client satisfaction.","á	Post Graduate Diploma in Telecom Management

GENERAL / DISTRICT / REGIONAL MANAGEMENT ● CUSTOMER SERVICE ● SALES / MARKETING
________________________________________
I have a well-rounded 20-year background with demonstrated strengths in reducing turnover, minimizing shrinkage and outperforming profit goals. My proven ability to determine the best merchandising, product placement and sales strategies that achieve optimal success coupled with an obsession for instilling customer loyalty has resulted in numerous corporate awards and other recognitions.
The scope of my career accomplishments has focused on:
	Operations management both in advanced district leadership and as Acting Regional Manager, in the RMs absence.
	Team building spanning multi-store locations and developing employee training programs which coached teams to achieve performance levels that exceeded management expectations.
	Loss prevention programming that reduced operational costs, increased profit margins and considerably decreased shrinkage.
The current economic recession has as you know, negatively-affected many long-standing companies and organizations. My 22-year record of achievement with a large retail enterprise that comprised of 1600 stores, serving 2.4 million customers daily, and operated in nine Midwestern states, ended unexpectedly when through corporate restructuring and subsequent unit sale, my position was eliminated.
	I held P&L responsibility for a 10-store district and acquired many awards for leading my district to top corporate rankings in both customer service excellence and shrinkage minimization.
I have never been one to sit around and wait for opportunity to come knocking at my door, and thusly, after my position was eliminated because the downstate operations was sold, I began and am currently, serving as a baseball coach for high school athletes and substitute high school teacher. I thoroughly enjoy the mentoring and coaching aspect of these roles. The skills I possessed in employee performance and training have easily transferred to effectiveness as coach and mentor to these students.
My goal is to replicate the successes I have had in my management career to a senior leadership role either in customer service, loss prevention, or overall general, district or regional management. I am very confident that I would provide immediate benefit to your organization in building and expanding corporate value.
