Attn: Hiring Executive
Re: District Sales Manager
Dear Hiring Executive:
I am applying for the District Sales Manager position that is available here in metro Atlanta and in surrounding areas. I am currently with Mitchell1, the leading Data, POS, and Mgmt. software system in automotive & Truck repair and I am a top salesman in the country. I possess a strong background in auto / truck parts and service. I will be comfortable in calling on Key Account clients from the executive down to the floor level. My success has always been due to the fact that I offer solutions to their problems. More importantly I learn new technology rapidly. But what I do not have to learn is how to sell. I am well versed on direct / and or indirect channels to market. I have over 30 years experience (parts & service)  in this industry. I am a strong consultive, solution style salesman, who writes orders. Back during the 1980s I had a small parts store, and from 1998-2011 we had a trailer dealership where sold and serviced Truck parts and trailers. I also learn quickly and completely. I have an extensive entrepreneurial background and spirit.
Possessing many years experience in technical, mechanical, and sales applications makes me ideal for this job I am adept at call planning, great follow-up and closing on sales leads, and I will bring a sense of urgency to the region, a hit the ground running strategy thus increasing market share and sales. I am a person who can instruct, motivate, mentor, and keep KEY accounts focused. I invented cooperative sales calls! I enjoy and will be successful with seminars and training with the reps & clients alike. Very strong client management if needed, as I become a crucial part of the clients team. I am also very good at supplying technical information when needed whether I know the answers or research to find out. But over my career the underlying thing that I sold was solutions to my customers problems. If youre looking to increase business and sales, please consider David McIntosh. On top of all this I am a very good closer myself. I teach the reps and others as I do myself: Dont write quotes, write orders! THIS IS A KEY MINDSET!
I have been specifically trained in working, negotiating and servicing Key Accounts and direct sales. Great ability to form long lasting relationships with Key Accounts. Customers do not care of what we know; they want to know we care about them.
Here is what 90  95% of the sales manager reps do customers or key accounts. They come in, not usually with a regular schedule. Might bring donuts or buy a lunch. Asks why sales are slow. Hands out a few brochures? Ask if anything they can do for distributor (maybe), and basically leaves with little on site work and / or follow-up. I know this is true because Ive seen these guys in action. Their high point is going out and writing 15 quotes! YOU CANNOT SPEND QUOTES. I write orders. I am effective with my accounts because I supply unheard of support. I become part of the team thereby increasing my presence, worth and dramatically increased sales. I will do training, training, and more training. I invented cooperative sales calls! I go out with the reps to clients to overcome objectives and write orders. Some other reps only want to go out to existing customers, OR LUNCH, not me; I want the customers that arent buying also, with lunch.
I am very experienced in doing presentations, to both large and small groups. I can teach and motivate the sales team to excel. I am expert on resolving customer issues and complaints. I also possess strong regional management skills. The product line is one that I can wrap my talents into. I will be able to negotiate large project pricing as I have negotiated deals upwards to $500K in my past. We will sell solutions and service, the technical side is what it is, but with my style we will be successful. So that you know I dont sell on price, I sell features and benefits, and my integrity.
My Strongpoints
EXCEPTIONAL KEY ASCCOUNT SALES & MANAGEMENT
STRONG MOTIVATION & MENTORING with our staff & accounts.
EXCELLANT MARKET AWARENESS & COMPETITOR ACTIVITY INTELLEGANCE GATHERING

Please review my experience and qualifications. I can be counted on to deliver the results that you are seeking. Please take my humor lightly!

David McIntosh","Professional Experience

I trained my employees on a weekly basis and devised comfortable, healthy competition between them for the purpose of sharpening their skills while improving their performance and confidence. I am a big believer in ROI tracking using multiple streams and devising creative ways to fall below the monthly budget month-on-month. My goal is to produce as much business as possible without spending ridiculous amounts of money to do so.The Internet/BDC Departments obviously require a budget to operate, though can do so efficiently without spending wildly, hoping that the wanton speding will produce warm bodies in the showroom. That is a misnomer that many stores and BDC/Internet Managers unfortunately believe very strongly in. A BDC is meant to produce business; this includes third-party lead management though also includes activities such as prospecting, referrals, videos, social media, mobile alerts and communication, etc. Having a process in place that is used by all BDR's is vital to proper lead management, as well as benefitting the sales floor and service departments.

my entire life.  My father was a dealer
and I sold my very first car in the 8th
grade, a 1978 Bandit-Edition Trans Am. I
have been a nationally recognized sales
consultant for Lexus of Nashville,
ranking 21st in the entire nation even
though Nashville was a small emerging
market.  After 8 years of selling, I was
promoted to GSM and served Lexus for 15
years.  I worked as GSM for Penske-Wynn
Ferrari Maserati in Las Vegas from 2007
to 2009.  I have performed every single
job within the dealership environment
and also owned my own high-line
dealership (Music City Motorsports) from
2003 to 2007 before selling my half.
I'm only 44 years old and have the world
by the tail.  Becoming GM at Lexus is
impossible unless an unforeseen tragedy
occurred, so I'm ready to move on to the
next level of GM and partial ownership.
My record is impeccable and my track
record is the best in the industry.  I
even won the very first National Lexus
walk-around competition as a sales
consultant.","EDUCATION

I have been in all aspects of it.Cars have been in my blood since birth.  I learned at a young age how to build motors and install them. I also learned transmission work, basic tune ups, and major overhauls.  As I got older I started working on cars myself.  I started to learn a little bit how each part makes a car function.  This started my interest in auto parts.
In 11th grade I took auto mechanics at Brownstown Vo-tech. I became  and auto technician .  As I reached my upper 20s I started working at Advanced Auto Parts.  I had a crash coarse in dealing with customers and mechanics and their needs.  Due to unsafe working conditions, I took a job working for Pepboys as a  ISR (Internal Sales Representative).  With this job, I  worked directly with dealerships and local garages. With this job I needed to be sharp on knowing  parts and how  to find them. Also the need to know the parts functions was a big need. I took a transfer to Florida with my now wife and daughter.  I worked there as a service writer.  It was a  great  job opportunity  but had no room for growth. So I searched till  I found a  job as a PSM (Parts Sales Manager) at AutoZone.  I worked there for 3 years.  I was able to handle managers duties while sharpening my  customer service skills It also helped me increase my  knowledge.  With AutoZone I was enrolled in a program called the Wit-Jr program.  This program through AutoZone was equivalent to the ASE Parts Certification.  The program helped to further my   knowledge and over all  functions.  When I transferred back to my home town, I found the cost of living wasnt the same as in Florida.  I didnt want to give up my skills and  knowledge and experience learned I needed more for myself and my family. So after a difficult  decision I decided to leave AutoZone and work for Napa. At Napa customer service, pulling the right orders, along with  knowledge was  key  to this  job. I found however that I reached the top of my growth within the company. This lead me to Cleveland Brothers CAT. I took a second shift job working as a parts specialist. My duties were to look up ,retrieve and supply parts for tractor and heavy machinery. I also handled all phone calls and walk-in customers. I had  to also make up hydraulic hoses as needed for all departments, loading truck with a tow motor filling out shipping labels. With this job I also was working by myself  so being self motivated was a big part of my job.  When my shift was over I had  to handle  the books for what was sold on my shift take care of the evening banking. And close up for the night. The importance of finding parts and getting them to my customers is something I take pride in.   With my life long experience invested I know I can provide the best customer service I can.
Through the use of  books as well as popular computer programs I have became proficient  in the  industry.  I also make sure  customers receive the right help first time.  While working with all different companies I was able to learn the ropes in dealing with the do it yourselfer, local garages, and some farm and heavy machine equipment.
So bundled together years of servicing this industry . I have become versatile in all forms as well as dealing with customers while taking care of mechanic needs. with  my  experience in this industry and cars, working on my own cars, dealing with  customers and mechanics  I can be a valuable asset for you while continuing to learn and grow within your company.","I have an Associates Degree In Automotive Technology from Ferris State University, Big Rapids, Mi. 1980 Grad.",,"Skills

Employment History
Virtual Services, Inc.				September 2005-July 2006
Senior Account Manager
My assigned territory included 10 named accounts that were either new named or cold accounts that were deemed critical.  I was hired to implement by example solution selling strategies in a very classical VAR business.    In 6 months, I won service business in 6 of my assigned 10 accounts and built a pipeline 3X my quota.  Duties included the all aspects of account research, lead development, targeted marketing and sales. Top priorities were lead identification, account strategies, and winning competitive lockouts, i.e., winning key service opportunities that would limit competitive selling.     All strategies executed within my top 10 named accounts.  I also worked very closely with inside sales/marketing to identify other new business opportunities.  Currently, I am year to date relative to Gross Profit quota, $300k bookings to $700k quota, which equates to $2.5-3.0M of product/services revenue.  A company restructuring and potentially sale have precipitated my job search.
Vultron Display Technologies			December 2004  September 2005
National Account Manager
Responsible for new account acquisition in six different industry verticals.  To tackle the challenge, I first developed and standardized corporate presentational and marketing materials for each of the six industry verticals, and introduced Vultron to industry leaders to leverage their influences.  Despite being one of the display industry cost leader, I year to date quota achievement with sales over $400,000.00.  The reason I left was that I was recruited by Virtual and lack business stability.
Synapsis						August 2004  December 2004
Consultant
After leaving Centor, I consulted with Synapsis on strategies to gain access into automotive market while I continued my job search.
Centor Software Corporation 				October 2003-August 2004
Sales Representative
Centor Software Corporation was an early stage start-up.  I was responsibility for all aspects of direct selling into the Automotive and Electronics markets with a focus on the OEM supply base.  My territory was a new name account territory.   Initially created a process to qualify the territory for fit with Centors applications, and created a prioritized target list of accounts.  Within 60 days, I was engaged with 10+ new named accounts, and within 120 days, had proposals issued to five accounts, with three purchasing commitments.    In parallel, I initiated a broader lead generation campaign to over 500 suppliers.   I met my 2003 sales objectives and in Fiscal Year 2004, met $500K new name business quota prior to Centors investors sold the assets of the company.
Marketing Specialist						April 2003-September 2003
I was responsible for building a sales pipeline for Centor, an early stage start-up.    I executed a direct calling lead generation campaign and increased a $2M pipeline to over $10M in 3 months.  This included direct contact with over 300 firms.   Leads generated were given to the existing sales force and I maintained focus on building a sales pipeline, until I was promoted to a direct selling position.   In addition to my lead generation activities, I evaluated sales barriers and developed critical marketing collateral needed to communicate Centors product capabilities and value proposition to its clients.
February 2001-April 2003
I took a sabbatical and attended to some personal matters while working in a family business.
Engineering Animation/					January 1999-January 2001
Unigraphics Solutions Corporation
(Note:  Engineering Animation was acquired by Unigraphics Solutions in 9/2000.  Prior to 9/00, I was directly employed by EAI.)
Account Development Manager
My primary responsibilities included helping define account development strategies around Unigraphics B2B design collaboration and digital prototyping solutions for major Tier 1and Tier 2 automotive suppliers.    I also had responsible for partnership management & development of Hewlett-Packard, Dell, and SGI as it related automotive opportunities.    I implemented new account prospecting/development methodology.   In addition because of sales bandwidth issues, I directly sold four new name accounts, and assisted in numerous other sale opportunities in support of other sales representatives.
Engineering Animation, Incorporated		February 1998-December 1998
Marketing Representative
My responsibilities included the introduction of Engineering Animations Incorporated (EAI) complete suite of products into assigned territory to accelerate sales campaigns and improve the efficiency of EAIs account managers.  My primary areas of focus were on lead generation in the Central region with specific emphasis on Ford, Chrysler, GE, Lockheed, and Boeing.  Additionally, I assumed direct sales responsibility for non-assigned accounts including a $200k new name account quota.   Prior to being promoted to my next position, I established critical marketing programs for EAIs Automotive Region.

Some changes we implemented include moving the A moving parts to be directly accessible, & restructuring the remaining parts  layout to group numeric.  We added RSG parts to increase fill rate and take advantage of the CFI discount. We reduced the parts inventory by $75,000.00 with our Oldsmobile termination, as well as, selling a large amount of obsolete inventory to a large dealer group. We implemented special order procedures to prevent future obsolescence.
The dealer asked that I also oversee the service department. Since then, we provided service menus for maintenance repairs,perform multi-point inspections to inform customers of current and future needs, improved service training from 60% to 95%, made our direct mailers and maintenance reminders more effective, inventoried and organized the special tools,  use mirror hang tags with pre GM CSI evaluation for feedback so we can address any concerns. We contact all our warranty service customers after their visit. We have also provided accessory catalogs with parts and labor pricing to each of our sales personnel to increase accessory sales opportunities.",,

Shannon High School, May 1999 --- 218 E Cherry St, Shannon, Mississippi 38868",,"Over my career, I have used Six Sigma methods since the early 80s when Motorola first successes were published in the Quality and Quality Progress magazines.  Used TQM and Lean Manufacturing methods for over 12 years beginning with Kaizen, Kanban, Poka-Yoke.  Plus I have over 40 industrial diagnostic and process improvement methods that are used in combination to effrectively resolve difficult, chronic process problems.  I have combined these into a system called, Improvement Sphere.  Difficult, complex, chronic problems often require a combination of three or four diagnostic and corrective method to arrive at an effective, permanent solution.
I have Power Point seminars on Six Sigma, TRIZ, Anticipatory Failure Determination, Quality Function Deployment, Opportunities to Improve Survey, and SPC.  I have organized improvement teams.  These teams concentrate on individual problems.  Through guiding the teams in using various tools, we solved problems that previously remained unsolved for several years.  One improvement team I led, had initial savings of $1,200,000 plus elimination of 14 operations, in 1989.
I improve and simplify systems. I aim at improvement and the ease of using SPC immediately at the process. I work well with others, building teams of production floor personnel, customers and suppliers to solve and prevent problems.  I led a team of suppliers to diagnose and resolve a customers assembly problem.  I did supplier surveys and worked with suppliers to make process improvements.
My strengths are leading, administrating, teaching, mentoring and empowering people around me.  I believe experienced people are the company's most important asset, therefore developing my associates skills is a high priority.
Worked with these processes:
Machining steel, cast iron, stainless steel, brass and aluminum alloys with drill presses, broaches, mills, lathes, hones, hobs, EDM, screw machines, and various grinders.

Employment History
Virtual Services, Inc.				September 2005-July 2006
Senior Account Manager
My assigned territory included 10 named accounts that were either new named or cold accounts that were deemed critical.  I was hired to implement by example solution selling strategies in a very classical VAR business.    In 6 months, I won service business in 6 of my assigned 10 accounts and built a pipeline 3X my quota.  Duties included the all aspects of account research, lead development, targeted marketing and sales. Top priorities were lead identification, account strategies, and winning competitive lockouts, i.e., winning key service opportunities that would limit competitive selling.     All strategies executed within my top 10 named accounts.  I also worked very closely with inside sales/marketing to identify other new business opportunities.  Currently, I am year to date relative to Gross Profit quota, $300k bookings to $700k quota, which equates to $2.5-3.0M of product/services revenue.  A company restructuring and potentially sale have precipitated my job search.
Vultron Display Technologies			December 2004  September 2005
National Account Manager
Responsible for new account acquisition in six different industry verticals.  To tackle the challenge, I first developed and standardized corporate presentational and marketing materials for each of the six industry verticals, and introduced Vultron to industry leaders to leverage their influences.  Despite being one of the display industry cost leader, I year to date quota achievement with sales over $400,000.00.  The reason I left was that I was recruited by Virtual and lack business stability.
Synapsis						August 2004  December 2004
Consultant
After leaving Centor, I consulted with Synapsis on strategies to gain access into automotive market while I continued my job search.
Centor Software Corporation 				October 2003-August 2004
Sales Representative
Centor Software Corporation was an early stage start-up.  I was responsibility for all aspects of direct selling into the Automotive and Electronics markets with a focus on the OEM supply base.  My territory was a new name account territory.   Initially created a process to qualify the territory for fit with Centors applications, and created a prioritized target list of accounts.  Within 60 days, I was engaged with 10+ new named accounts, and within 120 days, had proposals issued to five accounts, with three purchasing commitments.    In parallel, I initiated a broader lead generation campaign to over 500 suppliers.   I met my 2003 sales objectives and in Fiscal Year 2004, met $500K new name business quota prior to Centors investors sold the assets of the company.
Marketing Specialist						April 2003-September 2003
I was responsible for building a sales pipeline for Centor, an early stage start-up.    I executed a direct calling lead generation campaign and increased a $2M pipeline to over $10M in 3 months.  This included direct contact with over 300 firms.   Leads generated were given to the existing sales force and I maintained focus on building a sales pipeline, until I was promoted to a direct selling position.   In addition to my lead generation activities, I evaluated sales barriers and developed critical marketing collateral needed to communicate Centors product capabilities and value proposition to its clients.
February 2001-April 2003
I took a sabbatical and attended to some personal matters while working in a family business.
Engineering Animation/					January 1999-January 2001

(Note:  Engineering Animation was acquired by Unigraphics Solutions in 9/2000.  Prior to 9/00, I was directly employed by EAI.)
Account Development Manager
My primary responsibilities included helping define account development strategies around Unigraphics B2B design collaboration and digital prototyping solutions for major Tier 1and Tier 2 automotive suppliers.    I also had responsible for partnership management & development of Hewlett-Packard, Dell, and SGI as it related automotive opportunities.    I implemented new account prospecting/development methodology.   In addition because of sales bandwidth issues, I directly sold four new name accounts, and assisted in numerous other sale opportunities in support of other sales representatives.
Engineering Animation, Incorporated		February 1998-December 1998
Marketing Representative
My responsibilities included the introduction of Engineering Animations Incorporated (EAI) complete suite of products into assigned territory to accelerate sales campaigns and improve the efficiency of EAIs account managers.  My primary areas of focus were on lead generation in the Central region with specific emphasis on Ford, Chrysler, GE, Lockheed, and Boeing.  Additionally, I assumed direct sales responsibility for non-assigned accounts including a $200k new name account quota.   Prior to being promoted to my next position, I established critical marketing programs for EAIs Automotive Region.

Employment History
Virtual Services, Inc.				September 2005-July 2006
Senior Account Manager
My assigned territory included 10 named accounts that were either new named or cold accounts that were deemed critical.  I was hired to implement by example solution selling strategies in a very classical VAR business.    In 6 months, I won service business in 6 of my assigned 10 accounts and built a pipeline 3X my quota.  Duties included the all aspects of account research, lead development, targeted marketing and sales. Top priorities were lead identification, account strategies, and winning competitive lockouts, i.e., winning key service opportunities that would limit competitive selling.     All strategies executed within my top 10 named accounts.  I also worked very closely with inside sales/marketing to identify other new business opportunities.  Currently, I am year to date relative to Gross Profit quota, $300k bookings to $700k quota, which equates to $2.5-3.0M of product/services revenue.  A company restructuring and potentially sale have precipitated my job search.
Vultron Display Technologies			December 2004  September 2005
National Account Manager
Responsible for new account acquisition in six different industry verticals.  To tackle the challenge, I first developed and standardized corporate presentational and marketing materials for each of the six industry verticals, and introduced Vultron to industry leaders to leverage their influences.  Despite being one of the display industry cost leader, I year to date quota achievement with sales over $400,000.00.  The reason I left was that I was recruited by Virtual and lack business stability.

Consultant
After leaving Centor, I consulted with Synapsis on strategies to gain access into automotive market while I continued my job search.
Centor Software Corporation 				October 2003-August 2004
Sales Representative
Centor Software Corporation was an early stage start-up.  I was responsibility for all aspects of direct selling into the Automotive and Electronics markets with a focus on the OEM supply base.  My territory was a new name account territory.   Initially created a process to qualify the territory for fit with Centors applications, and created a prioritized target list of accounts.  Within 60 days, I was engaged with 10+ new named accounts, and within 120 days, had proposals issued to five accounts, with three purchasing commitments.    In parallel, I initiated a broader lead generation campaign to over 500 suppliers.   I met my 2003 sales objectives and in Fiscal Year 2004, met $500K new name business quota prior to Centors investors sold the assets of the company.
Marketing Specialist						April 2003-September 2003
I was responsible for building a sales pipeline for Centor, an early stage start-up.    I executed a direct calling lead generation campaign and increased a $2M pipeline to over $10M in 3 months.  This included direct contact with over 300 firms.   Leads generated were given to the existing sales force and I maintained focus on building a sales pipeline, until I was promoted to a direct selling position.   In addition to my lead generation activities, I evaluated sales barriers and developed critical marketing collateral needed to communicate Centors product capabilities and value proposition to its clients.
February 2001-April 2003
I took a sabbatical and attended to some personal matters while working in a family business.
