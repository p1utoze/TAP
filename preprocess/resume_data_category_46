Bilengual (English, Spanish)",Available upon request.,"The Arts were a solid foundation of my cultural
upbringing and influence. Like many artists, I began
learning this artistic language as a child. I would
draw, make sculptures with Play-Doh, and color
incessantly with my crayons. One of my earliest
memories is of coloring with my mother who taught
me not to scribble, but to take my time, make even
strokes and find the rhythm with my crayon; my
first exercise in patient diligence. At the age of
twelve I learned to draw what I see. Transforming a
colorful subject into black and white, I explored the
use of light and shadow in pencil studies. By the
time I reached high school, my talent had
impressed my teachers, and when asked what I
wanted to be when I *grew up,* it was the most
natural thing in the world to answer *I'll be an
artist.* As a young artist, a sizeable portion of my
education came through the studying of my favorite
works of art in museums. Jackson Pollack and Mark
Rothko define my early interest in a lack of control
mentality, Gerhard Richter for his diverse range of
styles and Alexander Caldor for his ingenuity and
work ethic. Some of these great masters provided
me with great inspiration and subsequently
affecting the way I approached my own art practice.
Continuing my desire to define my own personal
vision, in 2002, I attended Maryland Institute
College of Art. There I experienced life in a different
manner, at a different level - to see, to hear, to feel,
to think, in a more expansive way. I explored the
possibility of combining Fine Art and Graphic
Design. With this experimentation I was able to
capture different elements of our everyday world
and bring them together in one continuous visual
expression. For the first time I began to see my
identity emerge in my work. In 2009, I moved to
Mumbai, India to better my art and expand my
creativity in the field of film/video. July 2011, I
graduated with a Diploma in Filmmaking -
Specialization Direction. Now I am looking for a
position where I can merge both, Graphic Design
and Film/Video, sensibilities."

Problem  In 2008, airlines were facing many stresses due to the global economic crisis. Major airlines were being forced to reduce capacities, cancel flights and ground planes. Sabre Airline Solutions needed to reassure airlines not to decrease spending on technology that could potentially help them during these tough times.
Solution  Develop comprehensive strategy addressing airlines specific issues  fuel, revenue, customer loyalty and irregular operations  based on market research conducted with internal teams. Launch each issue as its own campaign including advertising, microsites, e-newsletters, videos, tradeshow graphics and sales collateral. Convey how Sabre Airline Solutions new products and services can help them overcome obstacles sited. Uphold companys long-standing leadership position visually by using updated version of brands signature airline windows.
Result  Even during a tough economic environment, Sabre Airline Solutions saw an upswing in sales, meeting their sales goal for 2009 by mid year. Trend continued in 2009 with rolled-out of simplified communications introducing new product suites that centered around the way airlines and airports operate. Sabre Airline Solutions also saw major wins with new airlines around the world and resigned many of their key customers.
Team Management and Growth  Sabre Holdings
Problem  The small print team of three designers was limited by high-volume production and the perception that an internal team could not compete against the creative muscle of ad agencies. Lack of budget for additional resources at headquarters kept team small.
Solution  Develop current resource skills. Hire additional production resources in other office locations globally to save costs, support regional efforts and augment skills at headquarters.
Result  First Sabre Holdings international design team was built and included print, Web design, Flash and video production skills. Regional marketing teams were better supported and brand messaging could roll out on a global scale simultaneously. Costs for video and Flash production were reduced. Time to market was reduced. Creativity was enhanced. Brand development and creative concept development was brought back in house, saving the company thousands of dollars. Internal team developed intimate knowledge of the company, its products, services, challenges and the challenges of the industry. Messaging created by internal team had highest ratings ever with customer focus groups and internal teams."

BENEFITS BOOKS: Cost for internal printing on the 2011 Benefits Books (quantity 1,400):
Paper (cover, text, shipping) = $637.60
Printing: (Digital Print Center will do Chargeback)
	Covers = $98.00
	Text pages = $3,332.00
Total: $4,067.70 ($2.91 per book)
Added benefit: no need to print quantity for full year  able to print on demand as needed.
2009 Costs for same project with external vendor, fewer pages, quantity 2,000: $7,117 ($3.56 per book)
2009 Books were distributed for 2 full years to current employees and new hires.
A quantity of 50 were discarded as out of date, value of $178
LAUNCH KIT DISTRIBUTION PROCESS:  All aspects of the process were examined and alternatives were investigated. It is recommended that we bring the launch kit process in-house  kit building would be performed by Sheltered Work Shop in Binghamton, and the distribution process would be managed by the Digital Print Center. This change is proposed in order to improve turn-around time, quality control, and cost savings.
Current turn around time: 		10-15 business days
Proposed turn around time:		8-10 business days
Time savings would be realized because launch kits would be built concurrently with the printing of the sales manual updates.
Current quality control:			mock-up sample provided
Proposed quality control:		actual kit with managers sign off
Quality control is critical for accuracy. The proposed process would require review of actual launch kit sample and approval sign off from MarCom and Product Managers.
Current costs (average of 3):		$6.71 each kit built
Proposed costs (estimated):		$0.34 each kit built
Cost savings would be significant. Our current fulfillment vendor cannot match this proposed cost, nor could the work be completed in-house for less considering overhead costs associated with time requirements.
Documented Cost Savings in 2008.

I have plenty of skills in HTML, CSS, Photoshop, and Dreamweaver. Throughout my experience, I've been able to overcome many hard design problems, which were usually easily solved by adding in a few CSS script tweaks. Below is a website I have designed from scratch. From background designs, video player design, and the tinniest bit of framing, was all designed by me from nothing. Positioning objects and framing is hard in itself for HTML/CSS coding; especially written from scratch. The only thing not designed by myself are the ads which are cleverly positioned even on different sized monitors (zoom in and out and see for yourself). They are linked to Google AdSense.

I have the internal motivation to work hard and succeed. My working experience in the advertising and graphic design industries has enabled me to achieve fluency in multiple design settings and themes. During my tenure at various design firms and a major toy company, my hands-on training as a designer and art director has enabled me to bring credibility to my clients and forward thinking approaches and ideas to my design team. My experience has provided me with both management and design direction enabling me to successfully manage many of my accounts from defining projects requirements to implementation, ensuring on-time deliveries and within budget. I am adverse at developing and presenting comprehensive proposals from RFPs including creative briefs and cost breakdowns.
In my decision to advance my career, I abandoned the hands-on design function of my duties in favor of advancing my career by being at the forefront of the creative phase. This advancement has given me the opportunity to interact with the client at the launch phase of a new project and just as rewarding by working closely with my creative staff in successfully developing a look that meets the needs of the client.
My core clients have included those within the entertainment, video gaming and toy industries. Other clients have included corporate entities, electronics and health and beauty. I handled all of their primary consumer packaging needs as well as brochures, sell sheets, advertisements, catalogs, style guides among many other collateral needs."

From 1993 until 1998 I was a scanner/image assembler using Heidelberg Topaz Scanner,  Adobe Photoshop, Quark Express, PageMaker, and Freehand on Macintosh computers.
From 1998 until the present I have been in the computer industry in various positions.

I'm in the unique situation of having extensive experience with dealing with clients, meeting deadlines and mastering programs (Photoshop, Microsoft Office, Illustrator and more), but am at a junior level with my web skills. My portfolio website is www.diedremuns.com.
I am looking for a position that uses my problem-solving, design and team-working skills. I am incredibly versatile and tenacious, so there are a wide variety of positions that are suitable. I've managed teams, and I've been one of the worker bees. I enjoy both for different reasons, so whether or not I am management is inconsequential. I'm just as happy designing as I am coding and problem-solving, so my exact task is flexible. It is pivotal though that I am working within a group on large tasks. Bouncing ideas off of talented colleagues, getting the opinions of employees and asking for input from superiors always improves the quality of my work. Nothing is more satisfying than the camaraderie built with teamwork and the quality of work it can produce.
My salary is flexible according to my duties. The salary noted here is a minimum for a standard, mid-level design position. I am willing to accept less for an entry-level Flash position and would want higher compensation for a management position.","PATTI LANE-FAULHABER

To Whom It May Concern:
I have worked with Debbie Peters for over five
years. During that time, I first worked with her as a
fellow Production Artist, before I moved on to
Supervisor of the Quality Control department for
TransWestern Publishing. She was very helpful to
me as I started my career in Production. I still
worked closely with Debbie as she was loaned to
my department at times when we were
experiencing high volumes of work. She worked any
task that was asked of her without complaint and
was always one of the top producers in any task
delegated to her. Debbie was also asked to work in
other multiple departments as volume dictated.
When TransWestern Publishing was purchased by
Yellow Book U.S.A., and then finally, when Debbie
was transferred to the Production side of the
purchase known as PindarSet she was then hired on
in my department, Studio Team II, as a Studio Artist
for PindarSet. Debbie continued her high standard
of work, becoming one of the top Artists in
accuracy and productivity world-wide. She was later
trained on the more difficult task of specification ad
design, which needed exceptional design skills to

After the acquisition of our San Diego Production
Studio, there was a backlog world-wide that needed
to be completed by January 2007. Debbie was
instrumental in helping to complete this backlog
and maintained her excellent accuracy and high
productivity scores in the process. She worked as
much overtime as she could to complete this
backlog. We met our deadline.
Because of Debbies accuracy, she helped Team II
maintain the highest accuracy scores world-wide.
San Diego Studio production as a whole maintained
the top productivity and accuracy scores
consistently once everyone was out of training.
Debbie is a hard-working individual. She is
considered one of the top employees I have worked
with. I will miss having her on my Team.

With over 8 years of experience in 3D Design and Multimedia, I am well equipped to take on your next project.
I am fluent in many different types of media including photorealistic 3D modeling, 3D architectural layouts, character development, rigging, texturing, keyframe animation, motion capture animation, lighting, compositing, special effects, video editing, print, photo retouching, logo design, and I have worked for some of the most talented and creative people in the industry.
My previous job was at Firstborn as an Architectural Modeler, Interior Designer, and 3D Character Artist.  I created photorealistic 3D fly-through of interior and exterior architectural designs using such tools as 3D Studio Max, Photoshop, and Mental Ray.  In addition I was responsible for creating character models using 3D Studio Max, Photoshop and Mental Ray for a nationally televised M&M's commercial.
I have also worked for Savva Inc, located out of New York, NY as a 3D Designer.  I was responsible for designing a 3D Sculpture of a Sleeping Baby using 3D Studio Max, Photoshop and Mental Ray for a memorial that will be displayed in a park located in New York, NY.  The sculpture of the sleeping baby was designed out of one inch by one inch metal pipe that had to be created with an orthogonal design.  Over one hundred and fifty beams were cut and welded together to create the sculpture of the Sleeping Baby.
Feel free to view examples of my work by simply clicking on the link provided below.  I am extremely detail-oriented, capable of meeting deadlines and juggling multiple projects while maintaining a positive attitude.  I look forward to hearing from you and having the opportunity to prove my skills.
Thank you for your time and have a great day,
Sincerely,
Aaron Martinez

used these skills for other jobs as well. One of the

decided, on a recent project, to give me the full

what they were looking for.
When realtor Mary Lou Cirello has a house that was
added to the market, she relies on me to get a
picture of the house and then a postcard created so
she can mail them to residents of the town.
Due to the fast and efficient work that my team
creates at Pearson, my full time job, the company
now requires other departments to use our services
rather then outsourcing which can be costly.
I personally have two Macintosh computers at home
and work with them at my current employer. I am
quite knowledgeable in hardware, software
installation and troubleshooting.  In fact, co-

Debbie Havilands
Art Full Of Love
In a magical realm beyond slate gray skies and
colorless days, lies a vibrant, dazzling palette that
touches the very soul, beckoning you to a place you
know youve been before. A place where the
warmest sunrises greet each day. Where hope
springs eternal from a snowmans smile. And
summer flowers caress your cheek with the delight
of the season.
Such is the enchanting inspirational world of
Debbie Haviland and her Art Full Of Love. Charming
yet romantic. Beautiful yet sweet and down to earth.
Each of Debbies creations evokes the love and joy
shared by everyone who believes that life is truly a
magical experience. And that goodness and light
always triumph just so long as we are willing to
ignite the flame.
The flame of Debbies magic has burned bright for
many clients who have watched Art Full Of Love
bring their products to life. And those products
have brought joy to all who allow Debbies art into
their lives. Those who know this enchantment
include The Gift Wrap Company, Leanin Tree,
Crown Point Graphics, Rug Barn and Crystal Tissue
just to name a few.
The list grows longer and now includes nonprofit
organizations like the  United Spinal Association
and The American Lung Association who find that
Art Full Of Love illustrates the care and compassion
they show to their fellow human beings.
Who will be next to experience Debbie Havilands
Art Full Of Love? Our hope is that it will be you."

I have lofty goals - and they keep me on my toes.
I consider myself to be a purist when it comes to development, not leaning on the WYSIWYG crutch but actually learning the languages needed to develop the projects Ive done for the web, and then finding what else they can do because I am so fascinated that I dive in to find out more.
When it comes to print design I have high standards. The best print media is the stuff that is done well. My father was a prepress worker - before the process went digital. I was taught all about bleeds, burns, and evil things like widows at a young age. I use Adobe CS2 & 3 for layout and design purposes. I measure, use the guides, use the styles, create multiple master pages I mean I really use the program as it was intended to be used.
I will stop at nothing stop get the job done. I will only publish my best work. I consider design and development to be united. I believe that the best design is conceived with a whole mind  cohesively. This makes my combination of skills useful because I can design back to front to back again understanding what both sides (developer and designer) are saying, and keeping the end user in mind. This is cohesive design. This is my goal.
Sincerely,
Nicole M. Creech","Web Developer and Pre-Press for Quality Images, Jacksonville, FL  [ OCT 2007 - PRESENT ]
